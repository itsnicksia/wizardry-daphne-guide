# Equipment Tables Wishlist

The tables below are auto-generated from the  [Wizardry Variants Equipment Table (editable)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j9gmngMUitaMAESlcCNeWJ5vAdMo_-yo8KkPxiMr1ZY/edit), which is a publicly editable Google Sheet. 

Items are grouped by type and sorted by subcategory. Missing enhancement levels follow the name in ().  You can add missing stats directly using the link above. 

If the table does not display correctly, try the [embedded version](./equipment-tables-embed.md).  The Wishlists are the first two tabs after the Instructions page.

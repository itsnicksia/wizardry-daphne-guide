# Dungeon Map Variations  
Many dungeon maps in the abyss, events, and other locations do not have a completely fixed layout.  Players often report confusion that their maps, or the locations of events, items, etc., do not match what may be shown on different guide pages. Thankfully, it turns out these maps are not random (at least so far, which is everything through Abyss 3), they are 'tiled'. While some of those tiles can move, key events/items/people on those tiles always occur in the same relative location on those tiles in their new position.  

!!! note "HELP I CAN't FIND XYZ!"
    In this guide we have made an attempt to have all references to locations either include a map pointing to the location, or using coordinates that relate to the main map shown on any of the dungeon map pages. If your map is different, just try to match features based on the tile moves described below.  Rooms are always the same shape, chests are always in the same spots in those rooms, they just moved. "

<em>"The discussion below focuses on examples in the Beginning Abyss, but so far applies to all other maps with tile variations."</em>

## Map Resetting
Certain events as well as actions by the player with the Cursed Wheel can 'reset' dungeon maps which may change map layouts that were you previously explored. For example, jumping all the way back to "Awakening" will reset the Beginning Abyss dungeon and layout. Below you see the Beginning Abyss map B1F as it might appear after having fully explored the map but then 'resetting' it and then entering by the Harken.  

Notice that all explored areas get a 'fog of war' effect that disappears when it re-enters your field of view (like the Harken Room shown), but also there are several areas 'blanked out' that will need to be reexplored anew, with each square being 'unexplored' until you step on that spot. Those blanked areas indiate variable map areas that <em>might</em> change their layout from the last time you were there, and where you may see layout differences from map to map in your game and on the guide site.

We notice that the variable maps can be sliced into a set of nine tiles that nicely divide the map and clearly show boundaries around the tiles that can change.

## Map tiling behavior and movement
Below, the tiles highlighted in blue are fixed tiles.  For most maps, most main story material occurs in these areas.  Any complicted dungeon effects often occur there as well (e.g., 2nd abyss waterways), as one would imagine the significantly increased design complexity of having those effects follow changing layouts.  The remaining tiles are the variable tiles.

These tiles can move, and rotate, and possibly flip in the new positions.

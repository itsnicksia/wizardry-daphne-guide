### Elden Hill (Witch Hunt) Faction Quests

Upon entering Route 4 and returning you will receive a message from the respective faction to return to Royal Capital Luknalia. Head to the Guild and speak with Arna. If you do not leave immediately, then you can select "Talk" in the Guild to receive the faction quest in the future. All of the faction quests take place in Elden Hill and share the same map (Witch's Cave). The objectives of each faction are different, but are all related to stopping the witch burnings and discovering its underlying cause. 

!!! note "Faction Affinity"
    - Faction affinity is based on whether that faction was selected in the Cursed Wheel for Abyss 2 and 3 
    - "Max" faction affinity is required for the "best" endings, 2x Guiding Lights (Luck), unique Calm Wind gear, and extra junk rewards

!!! warning "We are still determining the exact requirements for the 2 Guiding Lights (Luck). It is strongly recommended to set the Cursed Wheel to "max" faction affinity" before beginning."


**Witch's Cave Map** 

- Each faction can only access certain portions of the map. This is intentional. Stone pillars are used to block pathways and cannot be removed 
- Full map completion requires doing other faction quests
- Faction objectives can only be completed in the Witch's Cave and do not require visiting other locations
- Enemy level is (xx)
- Chests have unusually high Find and Disarm requirements

### Recovery of Salted Pork

??? warning "Important Notes"

    - Pre-requisite Requests
        - None    
        
    - Recommend entering Route 2 from the Route 1 Harken as the boss's location is based on your starting point. Entering from the Route 2 Harken has the boss fight commence in a blizzard zone, which makes the fight significantly more difficult
    - Bigfoot fights at Discovery Points can be as challenging as the boss and you may encounter more than one in a single run
    - Side areas do not contain Discovery Points
    - Bring SP items in case of multiple Bigfoot fights

??? note "Request Guide"

    === "Walkthrough"
    
        - Accept the request and enter Route 2 via the Route 1 Harken (recommended) or the Route 2 Harken. 
        - The objective is to traverse all of Route 2 from beginning to end to locate the stolen Salted Pork.
        - The Bigfoot Child will stop and make a sound at 6 Discovery Points along the main path. You have the option to "Let it go" or "Stop it". 
        - If you let it explore, then 3 randomized events can occur:  

            ??? quote "Bigfoot Child Audio Cues"
            
                - "Awooooon! Awooooon!" text with a "Mrrr" sound = Bigfoot fight 
                - "Kyoh! Kyoh!" text with a "Kyoh! Kyoh!" sound = Triffia 
                - "Kyoh! Kyoh!" text with a "Kyoh!" sound = Deep-snow Mushroom  
                
        - "Let it go" at least 4 times and one of those events must be a Bigfoot fight. Otherwise, the boss will not appear and the request will fail. Use the Fountain and hot spring on the floor to recover prior to engaging the boss.
        - The boss fight is against a Bigfoot + 2 Bigfoot Child in the frontline, 2 Bigfoot Child in the backline.
        - After the fight you will be given the option to "Spare" or "Kill" the Bigfoot and its child. The former gives a new bondmate and the latter gives additional gold. 
        - Remember to pick up the Salted Pork request item next to the Harken before exiting. It's easy to miss.
        - Return to the Guild and submit the request.

### Find My Kitty

??? warning "Important Notes"

    - Pre-requisite Requests
        - [Recovery of Salted Pork](./requests.md#recovery-of-salted-pork) 
        - [Find my Sister Lisa](./requests.md#find-my-sister-lisa) 
    - Request Failure
        - Pre-requisites requests not completed 
        - Did not receive the Dried Fish Fragment from the little girl at the Guild 
        - Exiting to the world map and returning
    - Reset Request
        - Cursed Wheel to Blizzard Blocking the Path, which will keep the pre-requisite requests flagged as completed

??? note "Request Guide" 

    === "Walkthrough"

        - Accept the request. If both prerequisite requests are completed, then the little girl will give you the Dried Fish Fragment. 
        - Head to Route 4. The kitty is only located in one of the 3 non-removable blizzard zones. For extra fun the Nullshadow will always appear behind you after entering a blizzard zone and stalk you throughout the search.
        - Running away more than twice results in request failure. Instead, let the Nullshadow kill your entire team. Upon reviving it will immediately despawn. Some blizzard zones have side areas of 1-2 normal tiles that can also trigger a despawn.
        - Finding the kitty is basically a game of hot-and-cold. It will make audible sounds as you explore with pop-up flavor text depending on your distance from its location. See Meow-chanics ₍^. .^₎.  The kitty will always be on the ground in the brush. Its location is randomized, but it tends to appear close to the swirling blizzards. 
        - Find the kitty once in each of the 3 blizzard zones. The first two times it will run away. On the third attempt you will be prompted to use the Dried Fish Fragment as bait and the request will be completed.
        - The kitty is now permanently located at the Guild. It can also see Lulu!

        - You catch a faint, barely audible cray of some unseen creature = Several tiles away, usually when you first enter the blizzard zone
        - You catch a soft, thin mewing from somewhere. It sounds like a cat = Few tiles away 
        - You catch the sound of a mewing cat nearby. It seems somewhere close by = Within 1-2 tiles

### Witch Hunt in Elden Hill Village (1st Faction Request)

##### Overview 

The faction requests are unlocked after entering Route 4 for the first time. The objectives of each faction are slightly different, but they all focus on stopping the witch burnings in Elden Hill Village and identifying the underlying cause. 

- Upon returning to Isberg a messenger will ask you to return to Royal Capital Luknalia
- Go to the Guild, speak with Arna, and accept the invitation
- If you leave immediately, then to accept the request in the future select "Talk" in the Guild
- All of the faction requests take place in Elden Hill Village and share the same map  

??? warning "Important Notes"

    === "Faction Affinity"
    
        - Supporting a faction in a previous Abyss influences certain outcomes 
        - Max faction affinity requires selecting that faction in the Cursed Wheel for Abyss 2 and 3
        - Max faction affinity is mandatory for the Best endings, 2 Guiding Lights (Luck), unique Calm Wind gear, and extra junk rewards
        - Faction affinity is denoted with a <span style="color: MediumOrchid">*</span>
    
            !!! note "Set max faction affinity in the Cursed Wheel before starting to avoid potentially having to redo an ending" 
    
    === "Endings" 

        Overview
        
        - 10 unique endings across all factions have been identified 
        - Some endings may have been missed as of 1/1 
        - Known endings are sufficient for unlocking the 2 Guiding Lights (Luck)
        - Princess faction is listed with 4 endings as the Best ending has 2 distinct sub-endings with different rewards and scenes 
    
        Endings per Faction
    
        - Princess: 4 
        - Pontiff: 3
        - Admiral: 3
        - Total: 10

??? tip "Guiding Lights"

    === "Unlock Conditions" 

        Friendly warning in advance that 1) the unlock conditions are likely bugged and 2) this entire process can be frustrating. 

        What is going on?
        - The main issue is Discord members have reported wildly inconsistent unlocking conditions. 
        - As of 1/3/26 we have confirmed that there is only 1 Guiding Light (Luck) tied to the 1st faction requests. The problem is that for some members it only unlocks _after_ clearing the 3rd or 4th GWO fight. For others it's been available on their first run before the GWO is ever encountered. 
        - Clearing the 4th GWO fight has been giving a Guiding Light (Luck) consistently, so that does not appear to be bugged.  
        - Until this is addressed all we can do is list the conditions that have been reported as "working". These might not work for you. It is also possible that this was shadow-patched at some point and is driving the inconsistencies between the older and newer reports. I have no idea.  
        - Remember to double-check that "max faction affinity" is set-up in your Cursed Wheel before you begin as it is a requirement. 
        - Here are the options identified so far:   
    
            - Any Best ending
            - All 3 Best endings (Note: This is likely the the intended condition)
            - Clear the 4th GWO fight + do each Best Ending until it appears

    === "Confirmed"
    
        - Max faction affinity is required 
        - A Guiding Light will dissolve if it's already been received 
        - The 2nd faction quests do not have a Guiding Light (that's been found to-date even with all "best" endings) and have nothing to do with unlocking this one, so please do not waste your valuable gaming time trying to do both at the same time.

    === "Contact" 
    
        - Please DM or ping @lightbearer on the Discord if you can confirm or provide additional information.

##### Pontiff Route

- The Pontiff route is a race against time to discover the identity of the witch to stop the ongoing witch burnings. The goal is to open the door to the witch's room on B2F as fast as possible.
- A demonic brazier blocks entry to the witch's room until you have made a certain number of offerings. However, each time you return to town for an offering an innocent person is burned.

    ??? note "Demonic Brazier"

        === "Process"
            
            - Interact with the brazier and it will request an offering
            - Collect the offering via fighting enemies or returning to town 
            - Give the offering to the brazier to unlock a nearby door 
            - Investigate the unlocked area until Lulu makes a comment 
            - Return to the brazier for a new offering request 
            - Repeat until the witch's door is unlocked
            - On a subsequent run you can speak with Tenet in town to reduce the total number of offering requests
        
        === "Offering Requests"

            - Only available after a first run
            - Talk to Tenet in town before entering the Witch's Cave
            - Select 1 of the 3 offerings in advance, reducing the total number of brazier requests

        Basics
    
        - Returning to town for an offering results in a witch burning
        - The total number of witch burnings determines whether Elencia is alive or dead after the boss fight
    
        Elencia's Status 
        
        - Witness 0-3 witch burnings = Elencia Alive
        - Witness 4+ witch burnings = Elencia Dead
        - The exact requirement for triggering a witch burning scene are unclear. Based on limited testing:
            - Number of battles and/or 
            - Returning to town after giving an offering, but before accepting the next brazier request

            - Total of 3 confirmed endings

                - Junk is not rewarded if any witch burnings are witnessed
                - Full gold reward is always given

        === "What Ending Should I Do First?"
        
            If you plan to do all 3 endings:
            
            - Bad Ending - Elencia Dead as all 5 brazier offering requests are required on a first run. However, returning to town only for the brazier offerings results in 3 witch burnings = Elencia Alive. 
            - An extra step is required. You must return to town an additional time after giving the brazier 3 Rabbits or Living Blood to see a 4th witch burning = Elincia Dead 
            - Select the Sheep from Tenent in town for the other 2 endings (Good, Best)
            - The Sheep immediately unlocks the witch's door, ensures 0 deaths, and Elencia will be alive after the boss fight
            
            If you only want the Guiding Light (Luck): 
            
            - Best Ending - Elencia Alive - "Condemn the Witch"

##### Admiral Route

- The Admiral's goal is to stop the witch hunts at the request of the elven Kinlord and his representative, Elinas, whose territory is adjacent to Elden Hill Village.
- To put an end to the witch burnings Pickerel suggests finding a "true" witch, threatening the local cleric to bring in the Cathedral Church, or sedating the villagers.   

??? warning "Mechanics"

    ??? note "Note on Initial Choices" 
    
        - The Admiral route is deceptively structured as the initial choices of "Capture a witch" or "Threaten" have no impact on the ending

## Minor Harken Beyond the Blizzard

### Special Local Delicacy

This request doesn't have any pre-requisites.

??? note "Request Guide"

    === "Walkthrough"

        - Get the request and head to Route 5.
        - Simply go to every Ice Storm zone, including ones that have trees that can be reversed. Typically the interaction zone is near the middle of the zones. When you enter the cutscene, you will get a description of the zone. These conditions are always randomized on every run. You are allowed to go to a spot and leave and come back later.
        - The options here are "The air here feels dry to you", "You can feel a brisk breeze, gusts rippling your clothing", "There is a slight dampness in the air here". You are looking for "The air here feels dry to you".
        - Upon selecting a spot, simply go through a 3 stage battle similar to that of previous abyss. You may tap out at any time. It is ideal to select a dry location where the Ice Storm may be removed via Right Hand of Reversal technique if possible.
        - Once all 3 battles are completed, you are teleported back to the tavern with the request completed. You will obtain some gold and an ice-wind trout.

    === "Battle Variations"

        - Variation 1:
            - 1st battle = 3 Goblins frontline + 1 Hobber backline
            - 2nd battle = 3 Snow Wolves frontline + 2 Baby Bigfoot backline
            - 3rd Battle = 3 Snow Wolves frontline, 2 Snow Hawks in the middle, 1 Big Snow Hawk backline
        - Variation 2:
            - 1st battle = 3 Goblins frontline + 1 Hobber backline
            - 2nd battle = 3 Snow Slimes frontline, 3 Ice Clouds in the middle, 2 Ice Clouds backline
            - 3rd Battle = 2 Snow Hawks frontline, 2 Snow Hawks in the middle, 2 Big Snow Hawks backline

    === "Bondmate"

        ??? warning "Ultimate Ice-Wind Trout"

            - The conditions are not entirely known, but some suggestions involve doing the fight with the ice storm active in the area, and then taking extra time in the last fight (essentially become frozen).
            - Upon completion, you will get an Ultimate Ice-Wind Trout instead, which heals slightly more than the normal trout.
            - In addition, you will get the bondmate "Exquisite Jewel Trout" (HP).

## Slaying the White Wolves

### Unforgivable Wolves

??? warning "Important Notes"

    - Pre-requisite request: 
        - [Special Local Delicacy](./requests.md#special-local-delicacy) 
        - If not completed the request will automatically fail otherwise 
    - Entering from the Route 6 Harken allows you to reverse the blizzard zones in advance before fighting
    - Cursed Wheeling twice on Truth of the Beautiful Ore and then wheeling to Slaying the White Wolves will automatically reverse all blizzard zones
    - There is no special text, sound, or battle music to signal a wolf pack encounter aside from the boss fight
    - Route 6 is extremely enemy dense with a high respawn rate, so try to avoid enemies or prepare accordingly
    - The Snow Wolf Leader is on par difficulty-wise as the Route 6 boss

??? note "Request Guide"

    === "Walkthrough" 

        - The objective is to hunt 4 wolf packs scattered across Route 6. The wolf pack locations are static, do not move on the field, and the order fought does not matter. Note that while there are 6 possible locations where they could spawn you will only get 4/6 to appear on a given run.  
        - The enemy composition of each fight progresses in a fixed order.
        - The wolf packs at (X:1, Y:23) and (X:11, Y: 19) are in a reversible blizzard zone and close to the Fountain. Recommend saving either for the boss fight. Do not leave the wolf pack in the bottom left at (X:4, Y:1) for last otherwise the boss will be fought in a blizzard.  
        - After defeating 3 wolf packs the 4th encounter will be a boss fight against the Snow Wolf Leader.
        - (Subsequent runs) A new option will appear to spare the Snow Wolf Leader. This skips the boss fight and gives a bondmate, Warg, Commander of the Deep Snow (Freeze Tolerance and Evasion). 
        - Exit and return to the Guild to submit the request.

            ??? warning "Rewards"
            
                - Gem of Org x20 (first-time only)
                - Snow Wolf Trapper Hat
                - 5,000 Gold 
                - Additional reward - 22,000 Gold 
                - Bondmate - Warg, Commander of the Deep Snow (subsequent runs only)

## Passed Through the Coal Mine

### Ore Mining

You need to complete Unforgivable Wolves. Otherwise, this request will automatically fail.

??? note "Request Guide"

    === "Walkthrough"

        - Head to Route 7 from Route 6 Harken. This is because you will need to access both Route 7 to Route 8 entrances.
        - The gist of this request is that you're picking up some rocks (shiny objects on the floor) in Route 8.
        - The location of several high value rocks are typically static. For example, (X:4,Y:8) and (X:26,Y:21) are guarded by 2 Stonefolk frontline, and 2 Lamenting Snowfolk backline. They have much higher HP and DEF than randomly encountered ones. These rocks are silver ore.
        - After collecting 5 rocks, return to turn them in. The merchant will test you on which rocks you think are most valuable and which are cheapest. He will pay you accordingly.
        - After potentially getting scammed, he will answer what type of rock is what type of material. Request completed.

    === "Map"

        ??? map "Ore Locations"

            <div align="center">
            ![](./img/ore-mining-loc.jpg)

            - Double marks = Boss enemy guarding ore

    === "Rock Values"

        1. Small Heavy White Stone = Silver, which coins are made of.
        2. Stone with Yellow Specks = Gold, but small amount so only worth 1/10th of a coin.
        3. Large Reddish Brown Stone = Iron (in high demand)
        4. Large Brownish-Green Stone = Copper (not worth much)
        5. Black Stone = Coal (not worth much)

## Short Rest in the Cabin

### Search for the Missing Persons (2nd Faction Request)

## Being That Dwells in the Home of God

### Traces of Indigenous People

You need to complete Ore Mining. Otherwise, this request will automatically fail.

!!! warning "The exact mechanics of this request isn't known for sure, but what's listed is perhaps how it works"

??? note "Request Guide"

    === "Walkthrough"

        - Accept request at tavern then head to Route 10 via Route 9 Harken.
        - You will essentially be looking for shiny objects on the floor.
        - Locations of all shiny objects are static: (X:17, Y:9), (X:7, Y:9), (X:13, Y:0)
        - Final shiny object will spawn after all 3 objects are collected at (X:6, Y:24)
        - Upon collection you will engage in a battle with Stonefolk. You can choose to decline the fight by putting the stone down, in which you may pick it up again. After winning the fight, the request will be marked as completed. You must return and turn it in.

            ??? warning "Rewards"
    
                - Turning in less than 3 stones = Just some gold
                - Turning in 3 stones = Gold and some junk
                - Turning in 3 stones + 1 large stone = Gold + 2 types of junk + Icebreaker sword

    === "Stone Locations"

        | Location | Enemies | Status Effect |
        |----------|---------|---------------|
        | (X:17, Y:9) | 1 Stonefolk | Whole team starts Cursed |

        | (X:6, Y:24) | 4 Stonefolk | Whole team starts with Fear |

        - The Stonefolk in these fights all have extremely high HP and DEF. The last battle will be even moreso, especially the ones in the back.

## Truth of the Beautiful Ore 

### Trial of the Stone God

This request requires Ore Mining and Find my Kitty (including all their pre-reqs obviously). You also need to have completed at least the 3rd ending for this abyss?

!!! bug "After the 2nd completion, Lulunarde will glitch onscreen briefly before disappearing and no longer calling out the request giver"

??? note "Request Guide"

    === "Walkthrough"

        - Request requires you to go to Route 10 to pick the warped daphnes and bring them to the Church Grounds altar at the bottom right of the map.
        - It's recommended to take the Church Grounds Harken and walk backwards to Route 10 as it is closer with less enemies.
        - The daphnes are consumed upon being placed on the altar, so any subsequent runs require you to pick them again.
        - Entering the altar will lock the door behind you. There will be several trials that must be overcome.

    === "Trials"

        ??? danger "Trial 1 - Ambush"

            - You will be jumped by 5 Stonefolk (3 in front, 2 in back). They have very high HP and DEF compared to random encounter ones.
            - (2nd run onwards) You may close your eyes to skip this fight.

        ??? danger "Trial 2 - Name"

            - The trial will ask for your name.
            - **Give your name** = Instant death (but this map has Harken's Blessing so you can revive for free). You will realize you got scammed by the request giver.
            - **Give a false name** = Fight more Stonefolk
            - **Stay silent** = Pass safely

        ??? danger "Trial 3 - Combat"

            - Fight another 5 Stonefolk (3 in front, 2 in the back).
            - Finally, you will reach the altar.

        ??? danger "The Altar"

            - The altar allows you to pray or not.
            - **Pray** = Instant death
            - **Do nothing** = Receive a Devotional Stone
            - After exiting the altar room, all the previous stationary Stonefolk become "sentries" that will force you into a difficult fight if you enter their line of sight. They can only see in a straight line in front of them and other Stonefolk block their line of sight. There will also be roaming enemies that are relatively weak.
            - Upon reaching the entrance of the altar, the door will unlock.

    === "Turn-in"

        ??? note "1st Run"

            - The request giver has ran away. Instead, the merchant from the Ore Mining request will appear.
            - He will tell you that you got scammed and ask to buy the Devotional Stone.
            - Selling it will give some flavor text that indicates the dwarves may want to use this stone.

        ??? note "2nd Run"

            - Lulunarde will ask you to try to sus out the person, but the new option doesn't really do anything.
            - The entire ordeal will play out the same, except you can skip the 1st Trial by closing your eyes.
            - When returning to the tavern, you can give the stone to the requester for some gold and junk. She will promptly be chased out by the ore merchant.
            - You will actually keep the Devotional Stone. Its use is not yet known.

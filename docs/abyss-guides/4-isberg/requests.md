### Elden Hill (Witch Hunt) Faction Quests

Upon entering Route 4 and returning you will receive a message from the respective faction to return to Royal Capital Luknalia. Head to the Guild and speak with Arna. If you do not leave immediately, then you can select "Talk" in the Guild to receive the faction quest in the future. All of the faction quests take place in Elden Hill and share the same map (Witch's Cave). The objectives of each faction are different, but are all related to stopping the witch burnings and discovering its underlying cause. Note that this set of faction quests is more complicated, darker in tone, and has a wider range of possible endings.   

!!! note "Faction Affinity"
    - Faction affinity is based on whether that faction was selected in the Cursed Wheel for Abyss 2 and 3 
    - Max faction affinity is required for the "best" endings, 2 Guiding Lights (Luck), unique Calm Wind gear, and extra junk rewards
    - Anything related to faction affinity will be denoted with a <span style="color: MediumOrchid">*</span>

!!! warning "The requirements for the 2 Guiding Lights (Luck) are still being determined. It is strongly recommended to set the Cursed Wheel to "max" faction affinity" before beginning."

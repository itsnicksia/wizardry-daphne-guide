### Elden Hill (Witch Hunt) Faction Quests

Upon entering Route 4 and returning you will receive a message from the respective faction to return to Royal Capital Luknalia. Go to the Guild and speak with Arna. If you do not leave immediately, then select the "Talk" option at the Guild to accept the faction quest in the future. All of the faction quests take place in Elden Hill Village and share the same map (Witch's Cave). 

The objectives of each faction are different, but related to stopping the witch burnings and discovering its underlying cause. This set of faction quests are more complicated, darker in tone, and have a wider range of possible endings than in previous Aybsses.   

!!! note "Faction Affinity"
    - Supporting a faction in a previous Abyss plays a role in the outcomes 
    - Max faction affinity is reached when that faction is selected for Abyss 2 and 3 in the Cursed Wheel 
    - Max faction affinity is required for the "best" endings, 2 Guiding Lights (Luck), unique Calm Wind gear, and extra junk rewards
    - Anything related to faction affinity is denoted with a <span style="color: MediumOrchid">*</span>

!!! note "To reset a faction request Cursed Wheel to "Deepsnow Hinterlands Entrance" and then "Blizzard Blocking the Path". Alternatively, "Minor Harken Beyond the Blizzard", as no floor change is needed to exit."

!!! warning "Unlock conditions for the 2 Guiding Lights (Luck) are still being determined. It is strongly recommended to set the Cursed Wheel to max faction affinity before starting."

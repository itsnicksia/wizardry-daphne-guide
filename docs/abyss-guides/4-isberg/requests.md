## Rare Ore Recovery Request

## Deepsnow Hinterlands Entrance

## Snowy Forest Minor Harken

### Recovery of Salted Pork

This request has no pre-requisites to accept.

- Obtain the request and either head to Route 1 Harken and walk up or head to Route 2 Harken. It's recommended to head from Route 1 Harken, as the final boss is located based on where you start. Starting at the Route 2 Harken has the fight commence in the snow near the entrance of Route 2, which makes the fight significantly more difficult. There is no difference in rewards for doing so.
- Essentially make your way from the entrance to the exit or vice versa. On the way there the Baby Bigfoot will stop and make a sound. You can choose to allow the event to occur or to stop it.
- You can tell what the event will be based on what the Baby Bigfoot says. "Mrrrr" = fighting a Bigfoot. "Kyou Kyou" = Truffles. "Kyou" = Mushrooms.
- You need to take a certain number of events (not sure exact amount at the moment), otherwise upon reaching the end, there will be no Bigfoot and the requests fails. Where the Baby Yeti stops is not random but there are many stops along the whole map.
- The final fight has you fighting a Bigfoot + 2 Baby Bigfoot in the frontline + 2 Baby Bigfoot in the backline.
- After winning the fight, you have the choice to spare the Bigfoot and Baby Bigfoot or killing them. Letting them go removes the truffle and unlocks a bondmate. Killing them grants bonus gold from the request giver.

## Village Shut Away in Silence 

### Find My Sister Lisa

This request has no pre-requisites to accept. However, to fully complete it, you will need to have successfully obtained the knowledge of reversing nullstones. It's also recommended to complete this request when you have already saved the children from the mines and have fully built the hut for them.

- Obtain the request and go to Route 3 Harken.
- Head to the mayor's house at the middle of the map. Obtain the Town Register from the desk, and then tap on the shiny object on the bottom right of the bookcase for a box, crude map, and a doll.
- Step outside and watch a cutscene of hostile animals showing up to the town.
- You will now need to kill all the mobs throughout the town, as well as finding all the objects at the X locations on the crude map BESIDES the top left one. The locations for the interactables are (X:7,Y:10) and (X:21,Y:1).

    1. Fight outside Mayor's house: 3 Goblins frontline, 3 Goblins backline
    2. Fight in alley behind Mayor's house: 2 Ice Slimes + 1 Bigfoot frontline, 2 Ice Slimes + Ice Vorpal Bunny in the middle, and Baby Yeti + Ice Slime backline.
    3. Fight in top left house area: 2 Snow Wolves + 1 Bigfoot frontline, Snow Wolf + Baby Yeti backline.
    4. Fight in bottom right house area: 3 Hobbers frontline, 3 Goblins backline
    5. Fight 1 in bottom middle house area: 2 Goblins frontline, 2 Goblins backline

    7. Fight in bottom left house area: 2 Ice Vorpal Bunnies, 3 Ice Slimes in the middle, 2 Baby Yetis in backline
    
 - You must also reverse the nullstone at the top left. If you cannot do so, the game will refuse to acknowledge that the request is complete and you will fail upon leaving the area.
 - If you completed all the previous tasks, Lulu will let you know its all completed. Head back to the tavern to turn in the request.
 - Head to the Route 9 Hut and pick up the little girl by the fire. Head to the top left nullstone in Route 3 and let the cutscene play out.
 - The route is now open and go down the path. Prepare to fight. The fight has a Snowpeak Cyclops + Hobber in the frontline + 3 Ice Slimes in the backline.
 - Pick up the last box a bit further down at (X:0, Y:16) and walk back to the nullstone for a cutscene. Return to the tavern and give the box and child to Marta for a bondmate + perfect completion.

### Find My Kitty

!!! warning "If you return the Adventurer's guild immediately after accepting the request and leaving, the request will fail automatically in your timeline, requiring cursed wheeling and re-completion of all the previous requests"

This request requires Recovery of Salted Pork, Find my Sister Lisa, and Special Local Delicary requests completed. If the request is attempted without these completed, the request will always end in failure.

- You will know if this request is completable as the little girl will speak and hand you some dried fish for the cat. If you attempt this request without this dried fish, the cat will always run away from you, resulting in failure
- Head to Route 4. The cat will always be located in one of the non-removable Ice Storm Zones in the map. In addition, once entering the zone, the white nullshadow will guaranteed spawn and begin chasing you. You must find the cat while the nullshadow chases you, as attempting to leave will have the nullshadow teleport directly to you. If you flee from the nullshadow more than twice, the request will automatically fail as the cat is scared off. However, if you are caught by the nullshadow it is recommended to simply let it kill you and resurrect on the spot, as that will despawn the nullshadow and allow you to freely look for the cat without consequences.
- The cat will always be in the brush (the walls essentially). It will make audible sounds and flavor text depending on how close you are to the cat.
      1."You catch the faint, barely audible cry of some unseen creature" - many tiles away
      2."You catch a soft, thin mewing from somewhere. It sounds like a cat" - a few tiles away
      3."You catch the sound of a cat mewing nearby. It seems somewhere close by" - it is within 1-2 tiles
- Catch the cat three times, once in each Ice Storm Zone. On the third attempt, select the option of using dried fish. This will complete the request.
- The cat will now permanently be in the Adventurer's Guild in the timeline. It can also see Lulunarde.

### Elden Hill (Witch Hunt) Faction Quests

Upon entering Route 4 and returning to Isberg a messenger from the respective faction will ask you to return to Royal Capital Luknalia. Go to the Guild and speak with Arna. If you do not leave immediately, then select the "Talk" option at the Guild to accept the faction quest in the future. All of the faction quests take place in Elden Hill Village and share the same map (The Witch's Cave). 

The objectives of each faction are different, but related to stopping the witch burnings and discovering its underlying cause. This set of faction quests are more complicated, darker in tone, and have a wider range of possible endings than in previous Aybsses.   

!!! note "Faction Affinity"
    - Supporting a faction in a previous Abyss plays a role in the outcomes 
    - Max faction affinity is achieved when that faction is selected in the Cursed Wheel for Abyss 2 and 3
    - Max faction affinity is required for the "best" endings, 2 Guiding Lights (Luck), unique Calm Wind gear, and extra junk rewards
    - Anything related to faction affinity is denoted with a <span style="color: MediumOrchid">*</span>

!!! note "To reset a faction request Cursed Wheel to "Deepsnow Hinterlands Entrance" and then "Blizzard Blocking the Path". Alternatively, "Minor Harken Beyond the Blizzard", is faster as no floor change is needed to exit."

!!! warning "Unlock conditions for the 2 Guiding Lights (Luck) are still being determined. We recommend seting the Cursed Wheel to max faction affinity before starting."

##### Pontiff Route

The Pontiff route is a race against time to discover the identity of the witch to stop the ongoing witch burnings. The goal is to open the door to the witch's room on BF2 as fast as possible, but requires making a certain number of offerings to a demonic brazier before the door unlocks. Several of the items it requests require you to return to town, which results in another innocent person dying. The endings are based on two conditions: 1) the number of innocent people killed and 2) whether the witch (Elencia) is alive or dead after the boss fight. 

??? "Brazier Offering Mechanic"

    In front of the door to the witch's room is a brazier that will request different offerings. Once given it will unlock one of the doors in the surrounding area. Investigate the unlocked area until you get Lulu's commentary. This triggers the brazier to make its next request. On a first run it requires 5 offerings to open the door to the witch's room 
    - 3 Rabbits = Defeat enemies in the area that contain vorpal bunnies 3 times
    - Hen = Return to town and speak with Tenet
    - Living Blood = Defeat "monster" (magical-beast, demi-human, demon?) enemies 2 times. You cannot return to town with the Monster Blood
    - Infant = Return to town and speak with Tenet
    - Sheep = Return to town and speak with Tenet

??? "Second+ Run - Tenet Offerings" 

    This feature is only available after a first run. Talk to Tenet in town before entering the Witch's Cave to select 1 of the 3 offerings in advance
    
    - Do not talk to Tenet = 5 offerings
    - Hen = 4 offerings
    - Infant = 2 offerings
    - Sheep = 1 offering 
    - Sheep will allow you to immediately unlock the witch's door 

??? "Witch Burning Mechanic"

    When returning to town for one of the offerings a scene will play of a villager being burned at the stake. The number of innocent villagers that die impacts whether the witch (Elencia) is alive or dead after the battle
    
    - Witness 0-3 deaths = Elincia lives
    - Witness 4 or more deaths = Elincia dies 
    - It is unclear the exact requirement for triggering a witch burning scene. Based on limited testing it seems to be 1) the number of battles and/or 2) returning to town after giving an offering, but before accepting the next request

There are a total of 3 (known) endings. 

!!! warning "What ending should I do first?"

    - It is recommended to do the "Elencia dies" ending on a first run
    - A first run requires doing all 5 brazier offerings
    - Returning to town only for the brazier offerings results in exactly 3 witch burning scenes
    - Return to town after offering the rabbits or living blood to see a 4th scene to ensure Elincia dies 
    - For the other 2 endings choose the "Sheep" in town from Tenent to ensure 0 deaths and Elencia being alive after the fight 

??? "Elencia dies"

    !!! tip "Rewards"
        - "Bad" ending
        - Achievement:  "A Witch There Was" [OR] No achievement if Elincia died in the Admiral route
        - 9,000 gold
        - Tenet remarks on how many innocent people died

??? "Elencia alive - "Condemn the witch""

    - After the boss fight select "Examine the body"
    - "Examing the head" 
    - "Pull it out"
    - "Prepare yourself" (either choice has no impact on the ending)
    - "Condemn the Witch"
    
    !!! tip "Rewards"
    
        - "Best" ending
        - Achievement: "Condemn the Witch"
        - 17,000 gold
        - 2 Junk (requires "Sheep" for 0 deaths)
        - Calm Wind Stun Guard<span style="color: MediumOrchid">*</span> 

??? "Elencia alive - "Tell the truth""

    - After the boss fight select "Examine the body"
    - "Examing the head" 
    - "Pull it out"
    - "Prepare yourself" (either choice has no impact on the ending)
    - "Condemn the Witch"

    !!! tip "Rewards"

## Minor Harken Beyond the Blizzard

### Special Local Delicacy

This request doesn't have any pre-requisites.

- Get the request and head to Route 5.
- Simply go to every Ice Storm zone, including ones that have trees that can be reversed. Typically the interaction zone is near the middle of the zones. When you enter the cutscene, you will get a description of the zone. These conditions are always randomized on every run. You are allowed to go to a spot and leave and come back later.
- The options here are "The air here feels dry to you",  "You can feel a brisk breeze, gusts rippling your clothing", "There is a slight dampness in the air here". You are looking for "The air here feels dry to you".
- Upon selecting a spot, simply go through a 3 stage battle similar to that of previous abyss. You may tap out at any time. It is ideal to select a dry location where the Ice Storm may be removed via Right Hand of Reversal technique if possible.
- There are two known variations of battles
      1. 1st battle = 3 Goblins frontline + 1 Hobber backline. 2nd battle = 3 Snow Wolves frontline + 2 Baby Bigfoot backline. 3rd Battle = 3 Snow Wolves frontline, 2 Snow Hawks in the middle, 1 Big Snow Hawk backline.
      2. 1st battle = 3 Goblins frontline + 1 Hobber backline. 2nd battle = 3 Snow Slimes frontline, 3 Ice Clouds in the middle, 2 Ice Clouds backline. 3rd Battle = 2 Snow Hawks frontline, 2 Snow Hawks in the middle, 2 Big Snow Hawks backline.
- Once all 3 battles are completed, you are teleported back to the tavern with the requests completed. You will obtain some gold and an ice-wind trout.

## Lakeshore Camp

## Slaying the White Wolves

### Unforgivable Wolves

You need to complete Special Local Delicacy. Otherwise, the issuer will run away and the request automatically fails.

- The gist of this request is to hunt 4 groups of wolves across Route 6. The wolf pack locations are static, and the order in which they are fought does not matter. The fights will always go in a specific order.
- It is recommended not to pick the last fight in an Ice Storm Zone.

#### Possible Coordinates (Route 6)

 - (X:11,Y:19)
 - (X:5,Y:18)
 - (X:16,Y:16)
 - (X:4,Y:1)
 - (X:1, Y:23)

#### Encounters

1. 4 Snow Wolves in a row
2. 5 Snow Wolves, 3 in the front, 2 in the back
3. 6 Snow Wolves, 3 in the front, 3 in the back
4. 4 Snow Wolves in the front, 1 Snow Wolf Leader in the back.

- Upon defeating the last pack, head back to the Adventurer's Guild and complete the request.
- Subsequent attempts on this request allows you to spare the Snow Wolf Leader, which grants a bondmate and skips the final fight.

## Passed Through the Coal Mine

### Ore Mining

You need to complete Unforgivable Wolves. Otherwise, this request will automatically fail.

- Head to Route 7 from Route 6 Harken. This is because you will need to access both Route 7 to Route 8 entrances.
- The gist of this request is that you're picking up some rocks (shiny objects on the floor) in Route 8.
- The location of several high value rocks are typically static. For example, (X:4,Y:8) and (X:26,Y:21) are guarded by 2 Stonefolk frontline, and 2 Lamenting Snowfolk backline. They have much higher HP and DEF than randomly encountered ones. These rocks are silver ore.
- After collecting 5 rocks, return to turn them in. The merchant will test you on which rocks you think are most valuable and which are cheapest. He will pay you accordingly.
- After potentially getting scammed, he will answer what type of rock is what type of material. Request completed.
      1. Small Heavy White Stone = Silver, which coins are made of.
      2. Stone with Yellow Specks = Gold, but small amount so only worth 1/10th of a coin.
      3. Large Reddish Brown Stone = Iron (in high demand)
      4. Large Brownish-Green Stone = Copper (not worth much)
      5. Black Stone = Coal (not worth much)

## Short Rest in the Cabin

## Being That Dwells in the Home of God

### Traces of Indigenous People

You need to complete Ore Mining. Otherwise, this request will automatically fail.

!!! warning "The exact mechanics of this request isn't known for sure, but what's listed is perhaps how it works"

- Accept request at tavern then head to Route 10 via Route 9 Harken.
- You will essentially be looking for a shiny object on the floor.
- Shiny object location order may possibly be random per player, but the locations of all objects are static. (X:17, Y:9), (X:7,Y:9),  (X:13,Y:0).
- Final shiny object will spawn after all 3 objects are collected. (X:6,Y:24).
- First run will always yield only 1 stone, which upon collection will engage the player in a battle with some Stonefolk. You can choose to decline the fight by putting the stone down, in which you may pick it up again. After winning the fight, the request will be marked as completed. You must return and turn it in.
- Upon cursed wheeling and accepting the request again, another stone will spawn in one of the static locations. Repeat until all 3 stones are collected.
- Upon cursed wheeling a 4th time? You'll find the final shiny object at the previously listed location.
- The fights are as follow:
      1. 1 Stonefolk + whole team starts with Cursed.
      2. 2 Stonefolk + whole team starts with Critical Poison.
      3. 3 Stonefolk + whole team starts with Paralysis.
      4. 4 Stonefolk + whole team starts with Fear.
- The Stonefolk/Lamenting Snowfolk in this fight all have extremely high HP and DEF. The last battle will be even moreso.
- Turning in less than 3 stones = Just some gold. Turning in 3 stones = gold and some junk. Turning in 3 stones + 1 large stone = gold + 2 types of junk + Icebreaker sword.

## Truth of the Beautiful Ore 

### Trial of the Stone God

This request requires Ore Mining and Find my Kitty (including all their pre-reqs obviously). You also need to have completed at least the 3rd ending for this abyss?

!!! bug "After the 2nd completion, Lulunarde will glitch onscreen briefly before disappearing and no longer calling out the request giver"

- Request requires you to go to Route 10 to pick the warped daphnes and bring them to the Church Grounds altar at the bottom right of the map.
- It's recommended to take the Church Grounds Harken and walk backwards to Route 10 as it is closer with less enemies.
- The daphnes are consumed upon being placed on the altar, so any subsequent runs require you to pick them again.
- Entering the altar will lock the door behind you. There will be several trials that must be overcome. The first trial will have you jumped by 5 Stonefolk (3 in front, 2 in back). They have very high HP and DEF compared to random encounter ones.
- The second trial will ask for your name. If you give your name, you will instantly be killed. However, this map has Harken's Blessing so you can revive for free. You will realize you got scammed by the request giver. If you give a false name, you will have to fight more stonefolk. If you stay silent, you can pass safely.
- The third trial will have you fight another 5 Stonefolk (3 in front, 2 in the back). Finally, you will reach the altar, which allows you to pray or not. If you pray, you will instantly die again. So do nothing and you will receive a Devotional Stone. Once to exit the alter room, all the previous stationary Stonefolks are now "sentries" that will automatically force you into a random relatively difficult fight if you enter their line of sight. They can only see in a straight line in front of them and other Stonefolk block their line of sight. There will also now be roaming enemies that are relatively weak. Upon reaching the entrance of the altar, the door will unlock.
- On the first return to the Tavern, the request giver has ran away and instead will be the merchant from the Ore Mining request. He will tell you that you got scammed and ask to buy the Devotional Stone. Doing so will give some flavor text that indicates that the dwarves may want to use this stone.
- On the second run, Lulunarde will ask you to try to sus out the person, but the new option doesn't really do anything. The entire ordeal will play out the exact same, except during the 1st Trial, you may close your eyes so that you can skip that fight.
- When returning to the tavern, you can give the stone to the requester for some gold and some junk. She will promptly be chased out by the ore merchant however. You will actually keep the Devotional Stone. It is not sure what this is for yet.

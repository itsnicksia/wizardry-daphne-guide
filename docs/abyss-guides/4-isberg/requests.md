    - Major spoilers ahead

!!! warning "Bugs Fixed"
    - The bugged requests appear to be fixed as of the 1/30 patch

??? tip "Things To Know In Advance"

    - We recommend you wait to do the Guild requests until after you have beaten the Abyss at least once 
    - Several requests require: 
        - The second reversal power, which can only be received after clearing GWO 4-3 
        - Successful completion of other requests, which are listed as "pre-requisites" 
    - The enemy difficulty is overall much higher with many requests requiring challenging back-to-back fights  
    - All requests are reset if you Cursed Wheel to a different Abyss 
    - The game saves the state of the map after defeating the GWO, including unlocked shortcuts (stumps, mines)
        - To update the map you have to "wheel-in-place" twice on Truth of the Beautiful Ore
        - Before starting a request (or multiple requests) do the above step and then Cursed Wheel to your desired node

### Recovery of Salted Pork

??? warning "Important Notes"

    - Pre-requisite Requests
        - None    
        
    - Recommend entering Route 2 from the Route 1 Harken as the boss's location is based on your starting point. Entering from the Route 2 Harken has the boss fight commence in a blizzard zone, which makes the fight significantly more difficult
    - Bigfoot fights at Discovery Points can be as challenging as the boss and you may encounter more than one in a single run
    - Side areas do not contain Discovery Points
    - Bring SP items in case of multiple Bigfoot fights

??? note "Request Guide"

    === "Walkthrough"
    
        - Accept the request and enter Route 2 via the Route 1 Harken (recommended) or the Route 2 Harken. 
        - The objective is to traverse all of Route 2 from beginning to end to locate the stolen Salted Pork.
        - The Bigfoot Child will stop and make a sound at 6 Discovery Points along the main path. You have the option to "Let it go" or "Stop it". 
        - If you let it explore, then 3 randomized events can occur:  

            ??? quote "Bigfoot Child Audio Cues"
            
                - "Awooooon! Awooooon!" text with a "Mrrr" sound = Bigfoot fight 
                - "Kyoh! Kyoh!" text with a "Kyoh! Kyoh!" sound = Triffia 
                - "Kyoh! Kyoh!" text with a "Kyoh!" sound = Deep-snow Mushroom  
                
        - "Let it go" at least 4 times and one of those events must be a Bigfoot fight. Otherwise, the boss will not appear and the request will fail. Use the Fountain and hot spring on the floor to recover prior to engaging the boss.
        - The boss fight is against a Bigfoot + 2 Bigfoot Child in the frontline, 2 Bigfoot Child in the backline.
        - After the fight you will be given the option to "Spare" or "Kill" the Bigfoot and its child. The former gives a new bondmate and the latter gives additional gold. 
        - Remember to pick up the Salted Pork request item next to the Harken before exiting. It's easy to miss.
        - Return to the Guild and submit the request.

## Blizzard Blocking the Path

### Find My Kitty

??? warning "Important Notes"

    - Pre-requisite Requests
        - [Recovery of Salted Pork](./requests.md#recovery-of-salted-pork) 
        - [Find my Sister Lisa](./requests.md#find-my-sister-lisa) 
    - Request Failure
        - Pre-requisites requests not completed 
        - Did not receive the Dried Fish Fragment from the little girl at the Guild 
        - Exiting to the world map and returning
    - Reset Request
        - Cursed Wheel to Blizzard Blocking the Path, which will keep the pre-requisite requests flagged as completed

??? note "Request Guide" 

    === "Walkthrough"

        - Accept the request. If both prerequisite requests are completed, then the little girl will give you the Dried Fish Fragment. 
        - Head to Route 4. The kitty is only located in one of the 3 non-removable blizzard zones. For extra fun the Nullshadow will always appear behind you after entering a blizzard zone and stalk you throughout the search.
        - Running away more than twice results in request failure. 
        - Note: As of 1/5, Discord members have reported that if the Nullshadow kills you and you revive, then instead of despawning it will result in request failure. This is currently undergoing verification.
        - Finding the kitty is basically a game of hot-and-cold. It will make audible sounds as you explore with pop-up flavor text depending on your distance from its location. See Meow-chanics ₍^. .^₎.  The kitty will always be on the ground in the brush. Its location is randomized, but it tends to appear close to the swirling blizzards. 
        - Find the kitty once in each of the 3 blizzard zones. The first two times it will run away. On the third attempt you will be prompted to use the Dried Fish Fragment as bait and the request will be completed.
        - The kitty is now permanently located at the Guild. It can also see Lulu!
    
            ??? warning "Rewards"
        
                - Gem of Org x20

    === "Meow-chanics ₍^. .^₎"
    
        - You catch a faint, barely audible cray of some unseen creature = Several tiles away, usually when you first enter the blizzard zone
        - You catch a soft, thin mewing from somewhere. It sounds like a cat = Few tiles away 
        - You catch the sound of a mewing cat nearby. It seems somewhere close by = Within 1-2 tiles

## Minor Harken Beyond the Blizzard

### Special Local Delicacy

??? "Important Notes"

    - Pre-requisite Requests
        - None
    - To save time you will want to Cursed Wheel to a node where all of the blizzard zones are still active. 
    - A few of the blizzard zones do not appear to work properly for the bondmate. Whether this is a bug or intentional is not known.

??? note "Request Guide"

    === "Walkthrough"

        - Accept the request and go to Route 5.
        - Simply go to every Ice Storm zone, including ones that have trees that can be reversed. Typically the interaction zone is near the middle of the zones. When you enter the cutscene, you will get a description of the zone. These conditions are always randomized on every run. You are allowed to go to a spot and leave and come back later.
        - The options here are "The air here feels dry to you", "You can feel a brisk breeze, gusts rippling your clothing", "There is a slight dampness in the air here". You are looking for "The air here feels dry to you".
        - Upon selecting a spot, simply go through a 3 stage battle similar to that of previous abyss. You may tap out at any time. It is ideal to select a dry location where the Ice Storm may be removed via Right Hand of Reversal technique if possible.
        - Once all 3 battles are completed, you are teleported back to the tavern with the request completed. You will obtain some gold and an ice-wind trout.

    === "Battle Variations"

        - Variation 1:
            - 1st battle = 3 Goblins frontline + 1 Hobber backline
            - 2nd battle = 3 Snow Wolves frontline + 2 Baby Bigfoot backline
            - 3rd Battle = 3 Snow Wolves frontline, 2 Snow Hawks in the middle, 1 Big Snow Hawk backline
        - Variation 2:
            - 1st battle = 3 Goblins frontline + 1 Hobber backline
            - 2nd battle = 3 Snow Slimes frontline, 3 Ice Clouds in the middle, 2 Ice Clouds backline
            - 3rd Battle = 2 Snow Hawks frontline, 2 Snow Hawks in the middle, 2 Big Snow Hawks backline

    === "Bondmate"

        ??? warning "Ultimate Ice-Wind Trout"

            - The conditions are not entirely known, but some suggestions involve doing the fight with the ice storm active in the area, and then taking extra time in the last fight (essentially become frozen).
            - Upon completion, you will get an Ultimate Ice-Wind Trout instead, which heals slightly more than the normal trout.
            - In addition, you will get the bondmate "Exquisite Jewel Trout" (HP).

## Slaying the White Wolves

### Unforgivable Wolves

??? warning "Important Notes"

    - Pre-requisite request: 
        - [Special Local Delicacy](./requests.md#special-local-delicacy) 
        - If not completed the request will automatically fail  
    - Entering from the Route 6 Harken allows you to reverse the blizzard zones in advance before fighting
    - Cursed Wheeling twice on Truth of the Beautiful Ore and then wheeling to Slaying the White Wolves will automatically reverse all blizzard zones
    - There is no special text, sound, or battle music to signal a wolf pack encounter aside from the boss fight
    - Route 6 is extremely enemy dense with a high respawn rate, so try to avoid enemies or prepare accordingly
    - The Snow Wolf Leader is on par difficulty-wise as the Route 6 boss

??? note "Request Guide"

    === "Walkthrough" 

        - The objective is to hunt 4 wolf packs scattered across Route 6. The wolf pack locations are static, do not move on the field, and the order fought does not matter. Note that while there are 6 possible locations where they could spawn you will only get 4/6 to appear on a given run.  
        - The enemy composition of each fight progresses in a fixed order.
        - The wolf packs at (X:1, Y:23) and (X:11, Y: 19) are in a reversible blizzard zone and close to the Fountain. Recommend saving either for the boss fight. Do not leave the wolf pack in the bottom left at (X:4, Y:1) for last otherwise the boss will be fought in a blizzard.  
        - After defeating 3 wolf packs the 4th encounter will be a boss fight against the Snow Wolf Leader.
        - (Subsequent runs) A new option will appear to spare the Snow Wolf Leader. This skips the boss fight and gives a bondmate, Warg, Commander of the Deep Snow (Freeze Tolerance and Evasion). 
        - Exit and return to the Guild to submit the request.

            ??? warning "Rewards"

## Passed Through the Coal Mine

### Ore Mining

??? warning "Important Notes" 

    - Pre-requisite request: 
        - [Unforgivable Wolves](./requests.md#unforgivable-wolves) 
        - If not completed the request will automatically fail  
    - The ore you are collecting is located on Route 8, which is split into two parts that are not connected to each other. 
    - Knowledge of [shortcuts](./important-request-gwo.md#learning-the-truth) is helpful to traverse the area easier, but it is not required. 

??? note "Request Guide"

    === "Walkthrough"

        - The goal of this request is to collect 5 rocks (white, shiny objects on the floor) scattered throughout Route 8.
        - You have two options on your preferred starting point:
            - Select Route 6 and then enter Route 7 to access the stairways to Route 8.
            - Select Route 7 and use the shortcuts to access the stairways to Route 8.
            - As previously noted, you have to explore both parts of Route 8 to collect all 5 stones and the order you do them in does not matter. 
        - The location of several high-value rocks are typically static. For example, (X:4,Y:8) and (X:26,Y:21) are guarded by 2 Stonefolk frontline, and 2 Lamenting Snowfolk backline. They have much higher HP and DEF than randomly encountered ones. These rocks are Silver Ore.
        - After collecting 5 rocks, return to the Guild and turn them in. The merchant will test you on which rocks you think are most valuable and which are cheapest. He will pay you accordingly.
        - After potentially getting scammed, he will answer what type of rock is what type of material. Request completed.

    === "Ore Locations"

        <div align="center">
        ![](./img/ore-mining-loc.jpg)
        </div>

        - Double marks = Boss enemy guarding ore

    === "Rock Values"

        1. Small Heavy White Stone = Silver, which coins are made of.
        2. Stone with Yellow Specks = Gold, but small amount so only worth 1/10th of a coin.
        3. Large Reddish Brown Stone = Iron (in high demand)
        4. Large Brownish-Green Stone = Copper (not worth much)
        5. Black Stone = Coal (not worth much)

## Being That Dwells in the Home of God

### Traces of Indigenous People

You need to complete Ore Mining. Otherwise, this request will automatically fail.

!!! warning "The exact mechanics of this request isn't known for sure, but what's listed is perhaps how it works"

??? note "Request Guide"

    === "Walkthrough"

        - Accept request at tavern then head to Route 10 via Route 9 Harken.
        - You will essentially be looking for shiny objects on the floor.
        - Locations of all shiny objects are static: (X:17, Y:9), (X:7, Y:9), (X:13, Y:0)
        - Final shiny object will spawn after all 3 objects are collected at (X:6, Y:24)
        - Upon collection you will engage in a battle with Stonefolk. You can choose to decline the fight by putting the stone down, in which you may pick it up again. After winning the fight, the request will be marked as completed. You must return and turn it in.

            ??? warning "Rewards"
    
                - Turning in less than 3 stones = Just some gold
                - Turning in 3 stones = Gold and some junk
                - Turning in 3 stones + 1 large stone = Gold + 2 types of junk + Icebreaker sword

    === "Stone Locations"

        | Location | Enemies | Status Effect |
        |----------|---------|---------------|
        | (X:17, Y:9) | 1 Stonefolk | Whole team starts Cursed |
        | (X:7, Y:9) | 3 Stonefolk | Whole team starts with Critical Poison |
        | (X:13, Y:0) | 2 Stonefolk | Whole team starts with Paralysis |
        | (X:6, Y:24) | 4 Stonefolk | Whole team starts with Fear |

        - The Stonefolk in these fights all have extremely high HP and DEF. The last battle will be even moreso, especially the ones in the back.

## Truth of the Beautiful Ore 

### Trial of the Stone God

This request requires Ore Mining and Find my Kitty (including all their pre-reqs obviously). You also need to have completed at least the 3rd ending for this abyss?

!!! bug "After the 2nd completion, Lulunarde will glitch onscreen briefly before disappearing and no longer calling out the request giver"

??? note "Request Guide"

    === "Walkthrough"

        - Request requires you to go to Route 10 to pick the warped daphnes and bring them to the Church Grounds altar at the bottom right of the map.
        - It's recommended to take the Church Grounds Harken and walk backwards to Route 10 as it is closer with less enemies.
        - The daphnes are consumed upon being placed on the altar, so any subsequent runs require you to pick them again.
        - Entering the altar will lock the door behind you. There will be several trials that must be overcome.

    === "Trials"

        ??? danger "Trial 1 - Ambush"

            - You will be jumped by 5 Stonefolk (3 in front, 2 in back). They have very high HP and DEF compared to random encounter ones.
            - (2nd run onwards) You may close your eyes to skip this fight.

        ??? danger "Trial 2 - Name"

            - The trial will ask for your name.
            - **Give your name** = Instant death (but this map has Harken's Blessing so you can revive for free). You will realize you got scammed by the request giver.
            - **Give a false name** = Fight more Stonefolk
            - **Stay silent** = Pass safely

        ??? danger "Trial 3 - Combat"

            - Fight another 5 Stonefolk (3 in front, 2 in the back).
            - Finally, you will reach the altar.

        ??? danger "The Altar"

            - The altar allows you to pray or not.
            - **Pray** = Instant death
            - **Do nothing** = Receive a Devotional Stone
            - After exiting the altar room, all the previous stationary Stonefolk become "sentries" that will force you into a difficult fight if you enter their line of sight. They can only see in a straight line in front of them and other Stonefolk block their line of sight. There will also be roaming enemies that are relatively weak.
            - Upon reaching the entrance of the altar, the door will unlock.

    === "Turn-in"

        ??? note "1st Run"

            - The request giver has ran away. Instead, the merchant from the Ore Mining request will appear.
            - He will tell you that you got scammed and ask to buy the Devotional Stone.
            - Selling it will give some flavor text that indicates the dwarves may want to use this stone.

        ??? note "2nd Run"

            - Lulunarde will ask you to try to sus out the person, but the new option doesn't really do anything.
            - The entire ordeal will play out the same, except you can skip the 1st Trial by closing your eyes.
            - When returning to the tavern, you can give the stone to the requester for some gold and junk. She will promptly be chased out by the ore merchant.
            - You will actually keep the Devotional Stone. Its use is not yet known.

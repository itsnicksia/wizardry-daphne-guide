## Snowy Forest Minor Harken

### Recovery of Salted Pork

??? warning "Important Notes"

    - No pre-requisite requests
    - Recommend entering Route 2 from the Route 1 Harken as the boss's location is based on your starting point. Entering from the Route 2 Harken has the boss fight commence in a blizzard zone, which makes the fight significantly more difficult
    - Bigfoot fights at discovery points can be as challenging as the boss and you may encounter more than one in a single run
    - Side areas do not contain discovery points
    - Bring SP items in case of multiple Bigfoot fights

??? note "Request Guide"

    === "Walkthrough"
    
        - Accept the request and enter Route 2 via the Route 1 Harken (recommended) or the Route 2 Harken. 
        - The objective is to traverse all of Route 2 from beginning to end to locate the stolen Salted Pork.
        - At 6 fixed locations (red stars) along the main path the Bigfoot Child will stop and make a sound. After the short scene you have the option to "Let it go" or "Stop it". If you opt to let it explore, then 3 randomized events can occur: 
        - You will need to "Let it go" at least 4 times and one of those events must be a Bigfoot fight. Otherwise, the boss will not appear and the request will fail. Use the Fountain and hot spring on the floor to recover prior to engaging the boss (filled-in red star).
        - The boss fight is against a Bigfoot + 2 Bigfoot Child in the frontline, 2 Bigfoot Child in the backline.
        - After the fight you will be given the option to "Spare" or "Kill" the Bigfoot and its child. The only difference is the former gives a new bondmate and the latter gives additional gold. 
        - Remember to pick up the Salted Pork (green star) next to the Harken before exiting. It's easy to miss.
        - Return to the Guild and submit the request.

## Blizzard Blocking the Path

### Find My Kitty

??? warning "Important Notes"

    - Pre-requisite requests:
        - [Recovery of Salted Pork](./requests.md#recovery-of-salted-pork) 
        - [Find my Sister Lisa](./requests.md#find-my-sister-lisa) 
    - The request will always end in failure if the pre-requisites are not completed beforehand
    - The Dried Fish Fragment from the little girl at the Guild is required to prevent the kitty from running away
    - Exiting to the world map and returning results in automatic request failure 
    - To reset, Cursed Wheel to Blizzard Blocking the Path, which will reset the request while keeping the pre-requisites flagged as completed

??? note "Request Guide" 

    - Accept the request and if all prerequisite requests are completed, then the little girl will give you the Dried Fish Fragment before you leave the Guild.
    - Head to Route 4. The kitty will always be located in one of the 3 non-removable blizzard zones. The challenge is that the white Nullshadow will pursue you as you search. It often appears behind you immediately after entering a blizzard zone.
    - Running away more than twice will result in request failure. Instead, let the Nullshadow kill your entire team as it will immediately despawn upon reviving and you can search freely. Some blizzard zones have side areas of 1-2 normal tiles that can also despawn your pursuer.
    - Finding the kitty is basically a game of hot-and-cold. As you explore it will make audible sounds with pop-up flavor text depending on your distance from its tile. The kitty will always be in the brush (i.e., walls). Although its location is randomized it seems to prefer being somewhere close to the swirling blizzards.

        ??? note "Meow-chanics ₍^. .^₎"
        
            - "You catch a faint, barely audible cray of some unseen creature" = Many tiles away, usually when you first enter the blizzard zone
            - "You catch a soft, thin mewing from somewhere. It sounds like a cat" = Few tiles away 
            - "You catch the sound of a mewing cat nearby. It seems somewhere close by" = Within 1-2 tiles

    - Catch the kitty once in each of the 3 blizzard zones. On the third attempt use the dried fish, which will complete the request.
    - The kitty is now permanently located at the Guild. It can also see Lulu!

        ??? warning "Rewards"
    
            - Gem of Org x20
            - 12,500 Gold

##### Pontiff Route

The Pontiff route is a race against time to discover the identity of the witch to stop the ongoing witch burnings. The goal is to open the door to the witch's room on B2F as fast as possible. 

A demonic brazier blocks entry to the witch's room until you have made a certain number of offerings. However, each time you return to town for an offering an innocent person is burned.  

??? warning "Mechanics" 

    ??? note "Brazier Offerings"

        ??? note "Process"
            
            - Interact with the brazier and it will request an offering
            - Collect the offering via fighting enemies or returning to town 
            - Give the offering to the brazier to unlock a nearby door 
            - Investigate the unlocked area until Lulu makes a comment 
            - Return to the brazier for a new offering request 
            - Repeat until the witch's door is unlocked
            - On a subsequent run you can speak with Tenet in town to reduce the total number of offering requests
        
        ??? note "Requests"
        
            - Request 1 - 3 Rabbits - Defeat 3 different enemy groups with vorpal bunnies

            - Talk to Tenet in town before entering the Witch's Cave
            - Select 1 of the 3 offerings in advance, reducing the total number of brazier requests 
        
            **Total Brazier Requests**
            
            - Do not talk to Tenet = 5 
            - Hen = 4

        - Returning to town for an offering results in a witch burning
        - The total number of witch burnings determines whether Elencia is alive or dead after the boss fight
    
        **Elencia's Status** 
        
        - Witness 0-3 witch burnings = Elencia alive
        - Witness 4+ witch burnings = Elencia dead
        - The exact requirement for triggering a witch burning scene are unclear. Based on limited testing:
            - Number of battles and/or

        - Junk rewards are reduced if any witch burnings are witnessed
        - Full gold reward is always given

        ??? note "What Ending Should I Do First?"
    
            **If you plan to do all 3 endings:**
        
            - "Bad Ending - Elencia Dead" is recommended since you have to do all 5 brazier offering requests on a first run
            - Returning to town _only_ for the brazier offerings results in 3 witch burnings = Elencia Alive 
            - An Extra step is required 
                - Return to town an additional time after giving the brazier 3 Rabbits or Living Blood to see a 4th witch burning = Elincia Dead 
            - Select the Sheep in town from Tenent for the other 2 endings (Good, Best)
            - The Sheep immediately unlocks the witch's door, ensures 0 deaths, and Elencia will be alive after the boss fight

        - An _additional_ trip back to town to witness the 4th witch burning is required
        - Recommend going after giving the brazier the 3 Rabbits or Living Blood

##### Admiral Route

The Admiral's goal is to stop the witch hunts at the request of the elven Kinlord and his representative, Elinas, whose territory is adjacent to Elden Hill Village. To put an end to the witch burnings Pickerel suggests finding a "true" witch, threatening the local cleric to bring in the Cathedral Church, or sedating the villagers.   

??? warning "Mechanics"

    ??? note "Note on Initial Choices" 
    
        - The Admiral route is deceptively structured as the initial choices of "Capture a witch" or "Threaten" have no impact on the ending
        - The number of brazier requests determines whether Elencia is alive or dead after the boss fight
        - Elencia's post-battle status (dead or alive) determines the ending
        - The "Prepare a sedative" option is self-contained and separate from the brazier offerings mechanic    
    
    ??? note "Brazier Offerings"

## Minor Harken Beyond the Blizzard

### Special Local Delicacy

This request doesn't have any pre-requisites.

- Get the request and head to Route 5.
- Simply go to every Ice Storm zone, including ones that have trees that can be reversed. Typically the interaction zone is near the middle of the zones. When you enter the cutscene, you will get a description of the zone. These conditions are always randomized on every run. You are allowed to go to a spot and leave and come back later.
- The options here are "The air here feels dry to you",  "You can feel a brisk breeze, gusts rippling your clothing", "There is a slight dampness in the air here". You are looking for "The air here feels dry to you".
- Upon selecting a spot, simply go through a 3 stage battle similar to that of previous abyss. You may tap out at any time. It is ideal to select a dry location where the Ice Storm may be removed via Right Hand of Reversal technique if possible.
- There are two known variations of battles
      1. 1st battle = 3 Goblins frontline + 1 Hobber backline. 2nd battle = 3 Snow Wolves frontline + 2 Baby Bigfoot backline. 3rd Battle = 3 Snow Wolves frontline, 2 Snow Hawks in the middle, 1 Big Snow Hawk backline.
      2. 1st battle = 3 Goblins frontline + 1 Hobber backline. 2nd battle = 3 Snow Slimes frontline, 3 Ice Clouds in the middle, 2 Ice Clouds backline. 3rd Battle = 2 Snow Hawks frontline, 2 Snow Hawks in the middle, 2 Big Snow Hawks backline.
- Once all 3 battles are completed, you are teleported back to the tavern with the requests completed. You will obtain some gold and an ice-wind trout.
- While the conditions are not entirely known, some suggestions involve doing the fight with the ice storm active in the area, and then taking extra time in the last fight (essentially become frozen). Upon completion, you will get an Ultimate Ice-Wind Trout instead, which heals slightly more than the normal trout. In addition, you will get a bondmate.

## Slaying the White Wolves

### Unforgivable Wolves

??? warning "Important Notes"

    - Pre-requisite request: 
        - [Special Local Delicacy](./requests.md#special-local-delicacy)

    - Entering from the Route 6 Harken allows you to reverse the blizzard zones in advance before fighting
    - Cursed Wheeling twice on Truth of the Beautiful Ore and then wheeling to Slaying the White Wolves will automatically reverse all blizzard zones
    - There is no special text, sound, or battle music to signal a wolf pack encounter aside from the boss fight
    - Route 6 is extremely enemy dense with a high respawn rate, so try to avoid enemies or prepare accordingly
    - The Snow Wolf Leader is on par difficulty-wise as the Route 6 boss

??? note "Request Guide"

    - The objective is to hunt 4 wolf packs scattered across Route 6. The wolf pack locations are static, do not move on the field, and the order fought does not matter. 
    - The enemy composition of each fight progresses in a fixed order.

            - (X:4,Y:1) - Southwest corner in blizzard zone (cannot reverse)
            - (X:1, Y:23) - Far northwest corner 

        ??? note "Wolf Pack Encounters"
        
            - Wolf Pack 1 - 4 Snow Wolves in a row
            - Wolf Pack 2 - 5 Snow Wolves, 3 in the front, 2 in the back
            - Wolf Pack 3 - 6 Snow Wolves, 3 in the front, 3 in the back
            - Wolf Pack 4 - 4 Snow Wolves in the front, 1 Snow Wolf Leader in the back
    
    - The wolf packs at (X:1, Y:23) and (X:11, Y: 19) are in a reversible blizzard zone and close to the Fountain. Recommend saving either for the boss fight. Do not leave the wolf pack in the bottom left at (X:4, Y:1) for last otherwise the boss will be fought in a blizzard.  
    - After defeating 3 wolf packs the 4th encounter will be a boss fight against the Snow Wolf Leader.
    - (Subsequent runs) A new option will appear to spare the Snow Wolf Leader. This skips the boss fight and gives a bondmate, Warg, Commander of the Deep Snow (Freeze Tolerance and Evasion). 
    - Exit and return to the Guild to submit the request.

        ??? warning "Rewards"

## Passed Through the Coal Mine

### Ore Mining

You need to complete Unforgivable Wolves. Otherwise, this request will automatically fail.

- Head to Route 7 from Route 6 Harken. This is because you will need to access both Route 7 to Route 8 entrances.
- The gist of this request is that you're picking up some rocks (shiny objects on the floor) in Route 8.
- The location of several high value rocks are typically static. For example, (X:4,Y:8) and (X:26,Y:21) are guarded by 2 Stonefolk frontline, and 2 Lamenting Snowfolk backline. They have much higher HP and DEF than randomly encountered ones. These rocks are silver ore.
- After collecting 5 rocks, return to turn them in. The merchant will test you on which rocks you think are most valuable and which are cheapest. He will pay you accordingly.
- After potentially getting scammed, he will answer what type of rock is what type of material. Request completed.
      1. Small Heavy White Stone = Silver, which coins are made of.
      2. Stone with Yellow Specks = Gold, but small amount so only worth 1/10th of a coin.
      3. Large Reddish Brown Stone = Iron (in high demand)
      4. Large Brownish-Green Stone = Copper (not worth much)
      5. Black Stone = Coal (not worth much)

### Search for the Missing Persons (2nd Faction Request)

##### Overview 

The faction requests are unlocked after entering Route 9 for the first time. The objective is to search for traces of two missing people and to discover why the faction called upon you, the Masked Adventurer, instead of employing their own members.

## Being That Dwells in the Home of God

### Traces of Indigenous People

You need to complete Ore Mining. Otherwise, this request will automatically fail.

!!! warning "The exact mechanics of this request isn't known for sure, but what's listed is perhaps how it works"

- Accept request at tavern then head to Route 10 via Route 9 Harken.
- You will essentially be looking for a shiny object on the floor.
- Shiny object location order may possibly be random per player, but the locations of all objects are static. (X:17, Y:9), (X:7,Y:9),  (X:13,Y:0). It is possible the next stone only spawns after 1 is picked up.
- Final shiny object will spawn after all 3 objects are collected. (X:6,Y:24).
- Upon collection will engage the player in a battle with some Stonefolk. You can choose to decline the fight by putting the stone down, in which you may pick it up again. After winning the fight, the request will be marked as completed. You must return and turn it in.
- The fights are as follow:
      1. 1 Stonefolk + whole team starts with Cursed.
      2. 2 Stonefolk + whole team starts with Critical Poison.
      3. 3 Stonefolk + whole team starts with Paralysis.
      4. 4 Stonefolk + whole team starts with Fear.
- The Stonefolk/Lamenting Snowfolk in this fight all have extremely high HP and DEF. The last battle will be even moreso.
- Turning in less than 3 stones = Just some gold. Turning in 3 stones = gold and some junk. Turning in 3 stones + 1 large stone = gold + 2 types of junk + Icebreaker sword.

## Truth of the Beautiful Ore 

### Trial of the Stone God

This request requires Ore Mining and Find my Kitty (including all their pre-reqs obviously). You also need to have completed at least the 3rd ending for this abyss?

!!! bug "After the 2nd completion, Lulunarde will glitch onscreen briefly before disappearing and no longer calling out the request giver"

- Request requires you to go to Route 10 to pick the warped daphnes and bring them to the Church Grounds altar at the bottom right of the map.
- It's recommended to take the Church Grounds Harken and walk backwards to Route 10 as it is closer with less enemies.
- The daphnes are consumed upon being placed on the altar, so any subsequent runs require you to pick them again.
- Entering the altar will lock the door behind you. There will be several trials that must be overcome. The first trial will have you jumped by 5 Stonefolk (3 in front, 2 in back). They have very high HP and DEF compared to random encounter ones.
- The second trial will ask for your name. If you give your name, you will instantly be killed. However, this map has Harken's Blessing so you can revive for free. You will realize you got scammed by the request giver. If you give a false name, you will have to fight more stonefolk. If you stay silent, you can pass safely.
- The third trial will have you fight another 5 Stonefolk (3 in front, 2 in the back). Finally, you will reach the altar, which allows you to pray or not. If you pray, you will instantly die again. So do nothing and you will receive a Devotional Stone. Once to exit the alter room, all the previous stationary Stonefolks are now "sentries" that will automatically force you into a random relatively difficult fight if you enter their line of sight. They can only see in a straight line in front of them and other Stonefolk block their line of sight. There will also now be roaming enemies that are relatively weak. Upon reaching the entrance of the altar, the door will unlock.
- On the first return to the Tavern, the request giver has ran away and instead will be the merchant from the Ore Mining request. He will tell you that you got scammed and ask to buy the Devotional Stone. Doing so will give some flavor text that indicates that the dwarves may want to use this stone.
- On the second run, Lulunarde will ask you to try to sus out the person, but the new option doesn't really do anything. The entire ordeal will play out the exact same, except during the 1st Trial, you may close your eyes so that you can skip that fight.
- When returning to the tavern, you can give the stone to the requester for some gold and some junk. She will promptly be chased out by the ore merchant however. You will actually keep the Devotional Stone. It is not sure what this is for yet.

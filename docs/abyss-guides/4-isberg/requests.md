### Elden Hill (Witch Hunt) Faction Quests

Upon entering Route 4 and returning you will receive a message from the respective faction to return to Royal Capital Luknalia. Head to the Guild and speak with Arna. If you do not leave immediately, then you can select "Talk" in the Guild to receive the faction quest in the future. All of the faction quests take place in Elden Hill and share the same map (Witch's Cave). 

The objectives of each faction are different, but related to stopping the witch burnings and discovering its underlying cause. This set of faction quests are more complicated, darker in tone, and has a wider range of possible endings than those in previous Aybsses.   

!!! note "Faction Affinity"
    - Supporting a faction in a previous Abyss plays a role in the outcomes of the faction quests
    - To reach maximum faction affinity the Cursed Wheel must have that faction selected for Abyss 2 and 3
    - Max faction affinity is required for the "best" endings, 2 Guiding Lights (Luck), unique Calm Wind gear, and extra junk rewards
    - Anything related to faction affinity will be denoted with a <span style="color: MediumOrchid">*</span>

!!! warning "Unlocking conditions for the 2 Guiding Lights (Luck) are still being determined. It is strongly recommended to set the Cursed Wheel to "max" faction affinity" before beginning."

### Elden Hill (Witch Hunt) Faction Quests

Upon entering Route 4 and returning you will receive a message from the respective faction to return to Royal Capital Luknalia. Head to the Guild and speak with Arna. If you do not leave immediately, then you can select "Talk" in the Guild to receive the faction quest in the future. All of the faction quests take place in Elden Hill and share the same map (Witch's Cave). The objectives of each faction are different, but are all related to stopping the witch burnings and discovering its underlying cause. Note that this set of faction quests is more complicated, darker in tone, and has a wider range of possible endings.   

!!! tip "Faction Affinity"
    - Faction affinity is based on whether that faction was selected in the Cursed Wheel for Abyss 2 and 3 
    - Max faction affinity is required for the "best" endings, 2 Guiding Lights (Luck), unique Calm Wind gear, and extra junk rewards
    - Anything related to faction affinity will be denoted with a <span style="color: MediumOrchid">*</span>

!!! warning "The requirements for the 2 Guiding Lights (Luck) are still being determined. It is strongly recommended to set the Cursed Wheel to "max" faction affinity" before beginning."

- Full map completion requires doing other faction quests
- Faction objectives can only be completed in the Witch's Cave and do not require visiting other locations
- Enemy level is (xx)
- Chests have unusually high Find and Disarm requirements

    - There is only one main path through the area and it will take you through BF1 and BF2, including the "sleepy tunnel" zone. It is quite long, so bring MP and SP items as a precaution 
    - To access BF2 drop down a hidden hole along the bottom path in the SE area. You may need to stand on the tile for a few seconds
    - For details on sleep tiles see "Herbalist"

??? note "Mystic"
    
    The Mystic option leads to the "best" ending and requires max faction affinity. The "Normal Route" has a completely different map and quest giver. The Fellwisp will only spawn on the Aegon route although the Cyclops will appear on both.

        ??? danger "Cyclops"
    
            - Boss strategy here
    
        - From the Cyclops side area the Sar-moon Herb is located to the northeast and requires reversing a stone to acess. Multiple enemies will spawn after it is picked up

# Deepsnow Hinterlands of Isberg - Important Request and Greater Warped One

!!! warning "This page is currently under construction. We are still refining and correcting details"

## Main Story Request Walkthrough:

### First Run through the Deepsnow Hinterlands

!!! note "An interesting feature for this Abyss is that there are footprints left in the snow. Both the MC and enemies that are not detected yet produce these footprints, so these are good indicators of where the enemy is if you cannot see them but hear them."

1. Head to Royal Capital Adventurer's Guild to receive your faction request of choice.
2. Head over to Valeon Grasslands and walk through all three plains. You'll occasionally encounter some NPC dialogues about Isberg on the way, and eventually get a short briefing from your faction representaive.
3. Deepsnow Hinterlands of Isberg's main town, Winterface Settlement, will not have anything of interest except maybe a cat as the tavern manager. To continue, head to the edge of town and enter the Abyss. You will be introduced to the chill/freezing mechanic along with the main gimmick of this abyss, which are portions of the map that inflict chill per turn and deny use of the minimap and map. Eventually you'll also reach a hot spring that can cleanse you of the chill/freeze debuff. Continue to Route 2.

    !!! item "Freeze Mechanic"
        - In applicable areas, snowstorm will take place at the start of turn, immediately applying 10 stacks of chill on every unit on the field (then deducting 2 stacks).
        - When chill reaches 0, applies frozen to the unit.
        - Frozen unit can still act and have increased Defense, but will have greatly reduced ASPD, ACC, and EVA. Frozen units can get shattered, which removes Frozen but inflicts a large amount of damage. Only certain actions can do this (Two-handed weapon actions). Fire actions will immediately clear chill/frozen. Enemies have a chance to break your frozen immediately and cause high damage with any skill, but certain enemy skills can guaranteed inflict heavy damage. For some reason Eruption Strike prioritizes clearing frozen/chill and does not trigger shatter.
        - Snowstorm reduces chill by 2 every turn, while water element skills reduce chill by 3. Some unique enemy skills can immediately reduce chill by large amounts.
        - Hot Springs and Camping can immediately remove all chill/frozen debuffs. Ice-Chipping Hammers are consumables that can also remove chill and freeze from a single unit.
        - Some equipment reduces chill stack reduction.

5. While going through Route 2, there will be a few cutscenes foreshadowing the upcoming fight on this floor. Upon reaching the end of the floor, you'll engage in a fight with Bigfoot.
  
    ??? danger "Bigfoot"
        - He will start with Empowered by Snowstorm then immediately cast Hip Attack to a random adventurer (Single target attack that also hits adjacent allies in the row). He has two baby bigfoots to his sides.
        - Like with many enemies in this abyss, he will cast skills out of turn when taking a certain amount of damage.
        - When taking a certain amount of damage, he will immediately cast his breath skill. The second time, he will chest pount and summon more baby bigfoots. The third time he will self buff with 10 turns of DEF, MDEF, and ATK up. The ATK is dispelled first.
        - Fire attacks will enrage him and can cause him to immediately cast his breath skill. However, fire attacks used after he self buffs will instead remove all his buffs and cause him to cast an undispellable infinite ATK UP and CT UP buff.
        - If Bigfoot is killed before all the baby bigfoots, the rest will be severely ATK debuffed and CT downed.
        
6. Enter Rockhome Village, which is seemingly empty. There is some information that can be obtained in the mayor's house right next to the Harken. If you return to town via the Harken at this point, you will receive the Faction-specific side-quest. You may go complete the request now or later. If later, continue onwards to Route 4.
7. While going through Route 4, you'll be introduced to another gimmick in this abyss, which is the Nullshadow. You will be chased by the Nullshadow. If you are caught, just flee from combat, you will die. Try to find a route to run away from the Nullshadow. Eventually you will be cornered and saved. You meet Iris, who is a main character for this abyss. She will save you once from the Nullshadow. Continue to Route 5. You should now have access to the request [Find My Kitty](requests.md#find-my-kitty).

    !!! item "Nullshadow Mechanic"
        - Whenever in a snowstorm area, there will be a chance the Nullshadow spawns nearby. It is a white ghostly version of the Greater Warped One of this abyss. There will be a sound cue whenever it shows up.
        - It is an unkillable enemy that typically casts Labadios on your team, typically dealing insane amounts of damage that drops HP to 1. If hit again while at 1 HP, it will kill the adventurer.
        - You will need to flee from the fight if you accidentally engage with the Nullshadow, as it's a guaranteed loss. It is very difficult to flee from the fight however, so it's recommended to not get into battle in the first place.
        - When you flee from the fight or leave the snowstorm area, it will despawn.

8. While going through Route 5, you will eventually get caught by the Nullshadow again. You will be stuck in a looping room with various spawned enemies and the Nullshadow. However, your character is getting very sleepy and the situation looks very dire. Lulunarde will mention how the snowstorm is making things very difficult and that it has something to do with trees blocking the wind. This scripted scenario will have your character constantly falling over and Lulunarde constantly waking you up. This scenario is similar to the drowning scenario in Abyss 2, where you will learn the Cursed Hand Technique for the Abyss in order to survive. There will be a tree stump in the center of the small room, where you must tap on it to revive the tree and stop the snowstorm. When the snowstorm subsides, the Nullshadow will also despawn. Third time finding a fallen fighter can be found just before Route 6, next to the harken. If you head to town at this point you'll see a notification that something in the [Well of the Mind](../../adventurer-customization/well-of-the-mind.md) has changed (STR 2 Guiding Light). Proceed to Route 6.

9. During your trek through Route 6, you will notice a lot of berry bushes that cannot be interacted with. It's ideal to note their location (or just look at the provided map). Upon going further, you'll eventually officially meet Iris, who is reluctant to talk to you. Upon exhausting the dialogue options, you'll be tasked with helping her collect snowberries. Return to all the snowberry bushes indicated and pick them. Each bush randomly can either give you a snowberry, give a half-eaten one, or trigger a fight. There will a fight where the snowberry is on the floor nearby, and another where the fight gives a snowberry directly. Upon gathering enough, head back and turn in the snowberries to Iris to gain her trust. You should now have access to the request [Special Local Deliver](requests.md#special-local-delicacy). As you continue towards the mine however, you'll eventually by surrounded by wolves. You'll need to kill the head wolf to progress.

    ??? danger "Snow Wolf Leader"
        - The fight has several other snow wolves in the same row and behind. The snow wolves are significantly weaker than the leader.
        - The wolves can summon another wolf into the fight, while the leader can summon multiple into the fight.
        - The leader can use an ice breath that immediately freezes a row. He can also summon an ice storm that also freezes everyone including his own units and himself in the battle.
        - When the leader is frozen AND there are 6 or more wolves on the field, he can cast Glacial Storm which is a full team AOE that does a lot of damage. It's recommended to break his frozen state ASAP.
        - It is also possible for the leader to cast Glacial Storm when taking a certain amount of damage regardless of previously stated conditions.
        - When he is about to die, he will summon an extremely large amount of snow wolves.
        - When the leader dies, all the remaining snow wolves will be greatly debuffed in attack and CT.

11. Route 7 is a Mineshaft where you'll eventually meet Nero. Gain his trust by helping him with his task of collecting ore on Route 8. Head downstairs using the stairs nearby and you'll be introduced to a small mechanic of this floor. The ores are located on the provided map. One is guarded by a Scorpion Lady + Hydra Plant + Desert Insects and the other is guarded by two Hydra Plants + Clouds + Desert Insects. After turning it in, head to the top left staircase and continue past Route 8 back to Route 7 and onwards to Route 9.

    !!! item "Poison Gas Mechanic"
        - Poison gas may initially be on the floor. Typically to clear it, you'll need to reverse the rockfall nearby.
        - However, rockfalls with no poison gas nearby can SOMETIMES generate poison gas. (consult map)
        - Poison gas tiles act effectively the same as a poison tile.
        
12. There is nothing very notable from Route 7 Harken to Route 9 to the Church on the first run. However, it is quite a slog after the Route 9 Harken so be prepared and play it smart.
13. Upon reaching the church, enter and interact with all the dead bodies on the floor. Head into the main church room and encounter the Greater Warped One. All the children will turn against you and the fight begins.

    ??? danger "Godefroi 1st Run"
        - He is surrounded by children. Do not attack the children as killing them greatly strengthens him. Each child has several hundred HP.
        - He is initially on the second row, so it's recommended to have ranged weapons/single target magic.
        - He can cast Kantios on your entire team. This is to get you to kill the children by accident. It's highly recommended to not have low fortitude when attempting. Alternatively, you can have two priests casting Makalki on each row every other turn if applicable.
        - He can cast Labadios and use a skill that inflicts bleed.
        - He can occasionally cast Maporfic (really strong makaltu) on everyone, so have dissipation.
        - He has around ~15k HP.

14. After defeating him, he will consume all the children and become powered up. This is a forced loss fight, and you will take a guaranteed fortitude loss on all party members that die before you die. Thanks Lulunarde.

### Learning the Truth

You now are under the impression that Godefroi is controlling the children. You need to prevent yourself from dying so you can obtain the Canary Crystals and complete the request.

1. To save time and reach Nero faster, you want to speed up the berry grind. Return to town and talk to the lady selling berries. Pay the lady and head to the tavern. Talk to the adventurer on the right side and buy him drinks based on the prompts. There is a tutorial in the tavern on what to do on the left side. After winning the minigame, pay him to get berries. You can wheel straight to Lakeshore Camp in the same faction route to turn in the berries.
2. Upon heading to the mines where Nero is, you can beat up the adults. Select "Give me the child" instead of looking for canary crystals, as the second option results in being ambushed. After talking to Nero and deciding where to go, step on the tile next to the coal wall nearby to learn the knowledge of crawling through holes in fences.
3. Head to the dilapidated cabin at the top of Route 9 and attempt to fix the cabin so the children can stay. Return to town and ask in the tavern. Talk to the man with his daughter and pay him. If you select the option of paying well, you will skip having to go to the Dwarves' Cave. If you choose to go to the Dwarves' Cave, you will need to help kill enemies in the cave indicated by green icons on the minimap. You will need to then move on to the next room and fight 2 Golems in the frontline, and 2 goblin mages + 1 goblin priest in the backline. Winning will grant you the lumber needed + an Ice Axe. Head back to the cabin to see it built.
4. Proceed to the church. You can skip Route 10 entirely by cursed wheeling forward with the appropriate options selected.

    ??? danger "Godefroi 2nd Run"
        - There are no children this time. He is by himself
        - He starts off casting Balafeos on you. It's very recommended to cleanse this debuff as it's extremely potent.
        - He will cast various skills after taking enough damage. It will essentially be a skill showcase of what he can cast later on.
        - Some spells he can cast are Madalto, full team Kantios, Maporfic, Nofis, and full team "Horrific Roar" which is a fear.
        - He will hit harder than that of the first run, but not anything too serious.

5. After defeating him, the adults will burst in looking for you. You explain that you're working for whatever specific faction you select, and they will be pleased that you defeated Godefroi. They will promise you delivery of the Canary Crystals. The children do not look very happy.
6. Proceed into the other rooms of the church. There will be some documents on the floor you can reverse. You thus gain the knowledge that Canary Crystals are transmuted human children that are subject to extreme torture, which for some reason transforms them into a crystal.
7. Leave the church through any door and be transported to the Royal Capital where the request is automatically turned in. 

### Stopping the Adults

Realizing that the situation occuring in this village is extremely vile, you decide to wheel back in time to prevent this problem.

??? warning "Important Notes"

    - Cursed Wheel Settings 
    - Short Rest in the Cabin 
        - North Lakeshore Cabin: "Fixed it up"
        - Dwarves' Cave: Any 
        - Village Adults: "Did not encounter them"

    - Other Notes 
    
        - It is important that you do Mike (Route 3) first as the game can get buggy if you attempt to do them in a different order 
        - After defeating Mike, it is recommended to do Otto (Route 6) next since he has a chance of escaping and will reset all of your progress if he runs away 
        - For Route 4 you should see a pure white square (cart) in the middle of the map, which means the game loaded the adult fight properly. It is important that you enter from the Route 6 Harken otherwise the cart will bar your progression (if coming from the entrance)
        - The Mayor will not appear until all the other adults are captured 
        - There is a unique achievement for killing all of them, but for story progression you want to make sure they all survive 

1. You need to cursed wheel back to when the cabin in Route 9 was fully rebuilt, Short Rest in the Cabin. Approaching the cabin has Lulunarde suggesting that we need to deal with the adults before heading towards defeating Godefroi.
2. You need to head to Route 3's Rockhome Village. Walking towards the Mayor's house from the harken will show that the town is trapped. Head towards the house at the bottom middle of the map to find Mike. He will attempt to defend himself with goblins, which end up turning on him. You will have to fight three goblins. After winning, Lulunarde will name 3 more locations that adults may be at. You can visit any of these points in any order that you want.
3. Route 4's Snowy Road to the Mine requires you to head towards the middle of the map. You will notice a cart with rocks on it. Interact with it and turn around to find one of the adults. He will lock you in and then throw meat to lure monsters to deal with you. Head slightly south to find him again and you may choose any option to deal with him.

!!! danger "All the adults in which you fight in combat have the capacity to run away if you take too long with the overall battle, even if you killed them first. This will ruin your progress for the section."

4. Route 7's Depleted Mine 1F requires you to teleport to the harken and then head to the staircase at the bottom right. Taking a few steps forwards will activate a rockfall trap that also spawns poison cloud tiles around you. Reverse the rockfall trap if you wish and move towards the NPC icon on the map to find Lucas. He will then gas the whole room and release numerous enemies in the room and corridor outside. Walk slightly up to find him again and start a fight. There will be 3 baby bigfoots in the front row, with him and a Bigfoot in the back row. Defeat him and deal with him however you choose.
5. Route 6's South Lakeshore adult, Otto, will initially be located at X:14, Y:11. He will run away to X:11, Y:2. He will run away again to X:5, Y:1. Then finally, he will run away to X:1, Y:17. It will be a fight with several snow hawks, big snow hawks, and himself. If you do not kill all enemies quickly he will escape the fight regardless of what order kills are done, and he can flee even if killed first.  All actions count for this fight, both enemy and yours, if too many actions occur he will flee.  Many of the birds will use their first round free actions to buff themselves with accellarate.  It is critical this buff be removed ASAP to reduce enemy actions, mages are very strong here as Maelefic Wind can do damage and remove accellarate at the same time.  Ideally you also want to enter this fight with no chill stacks to reduce risk of being frozen by the birds with bad RNG.   
6. Route 9's North Lakeshore adult is the Mayor and he is located at X:15, Y:15. He is surrounded by many packs of Snow Wolves + a Snow Wolf Leader. He will then run away to the nearby cabin south. You will need to fight your way to him and then fight the pack defending the door. Then finally you will need to fight him with his pack of 4 Snow Wolves and a Snow Wolf Leader.
7. After suppressing all the adults, it will be recorded in the Cursed Wheel and will be okay to Cursed Wheel ahead to the Church map to once again fight Godefroi.

    ??? danger "Godefroi 3rd Run"
        - This time he is fully powered and spawns with 2 ice pillars. These ice pillars greatly reduces the physical damage he takes and will inflict Chill on your entire team every turn. It is recommended to destroy these asap. They are quite fragile and weak to fire.
        - Godfrei has all the skills has has from the previous runs and will cast skills occasionally when taking enough damage.
        - Godfrei is more likely to target a frozen unit with a very strong physical skill that is likely to instantly kill them. Hence why to destroy the ice pillars.
        - He can re-summon the ice pillars after a certain number of turns.

8. After defeating Godefroi, Iris will come running in and be extremely sad that the priest is dead. Lulunarde suggests looking around the church to find the source of canary crystals. You head to the well and find out that there is a torture chamber that was being used to turn children into canary crystals. The only way forward is blocked by a nullstone, so you leave only to be confronted by Iris. Her extreme sadness causes her to transmute into a canary crystal herself that covers the well. You gain knowledge that this crystallization effect is due to a powerful Wizardry effect like your Right Hand of Reversal and therefore cannot be affected by it. You are able to break off a part of her crystal and turn it in at the Royal Capital to complete the request.

### Saving Iris

You feel that if you do everything correctly, you can also save Iris from her fate.

1. Cursed Wheel to Short Rest in the Cabin with the cabin fixed and adults secured. From this point, teleport to Route 3's Rockhome Village. Head to Iris's House at the middle right of the map. There will be two nullstones in there. Exhaust all options in there and gain the idea to possibly try reversing the nullstone. It ends up working and you can the knowledge to do so on all nullstones. Reverse both parents, attempt to open the trapdoor on the floor, attempt to push the nullstone, and then head to Route 9's North Lakeshore to find Iris waiting outside of the cabin. Ask her if she wants to see her parents. Return to her house and the nullstone covering the trapdoor will walk off of it. Head down to the basement altar and interact with everything down there. You will learn that it is possible to cure Iris's vision, as it may allow her to truly see what the Greater Warped One looks like.
2. You will need Creeping Crud Ichor and Glitterstone Ore. Head to Route 7 via Route 6's Harken and walk upwards. You will see a stationary green enemy icon in a nearby room, which will drop the ichor. The exact coordinates for this enemy is X:16, Y:6. Leave and then head to Route 8 via Route 7's Harken and the bottom right staircase. Glitterstone Ore will be located at the top right or bottom left of the map (it will be a 2x2 room with a 1 square protrusion). It's recommended to kill all the enemies on the way there as Glitterstone Ore is very fragile and will break if you take too much damage in battles.

    !!! note "Glitterstone Ore Location"
         ![](./img/glitterstone-structure.png)
   
4. Head back to Iris's House and bring her with you. Herbalist's Shrine will unlock on the world map. You will need to head there. Head into the dungeon and find the Herbalist in a nearby room. She will need you to fetch some water in the shrine. The water will be located at the top left of the map. Upon reaching the water, you will have to fight a Lizardman Champion with some Sahuagin. Like many other enemies in this abyss, he can cast typical Lizardman Champion skills out of turn when he takes enough damage. All of these skills do extremely high amounts of physical damage so be prepared.
5. Return to the Herbalist and watch a cutscene of Iris regaining her eyesight. You can now head to the church and defeat Godefroi. Skip Route 10 via cursed wheel with the eye fixed option.
6. When confronting Godefroi, it seems that Iris still believes that the priest's soul is still there. She understands that you must defeat the demon that is confining the priest.

    ??? danger "Godefroi True End Fight"
        - The final fight is unique in that he has multiple HP pools (roughly 4-5 at 10-12.5K HP each). Total HP is roughly ~50K. This is one of the key reasons to not push damage too quickly as it is possible to "overkill" a single HP pool and prompt his hard-hitting out-of-turn actions. 
        - Kill ice pillars ASAP (LA- spells are good) they have ~1000 hp. These increase physical dmg reduction of all units on the field by an insane amount + cast chill on the entire team. For reference, ~510 magic power + lvl 2 Lahalito is enough to kill all of them in 1 turn. Physical attacks work as well, but require a lot of attack and high skill level.
        - Kill ghost kids QUICKLY (within 3 turns), they only have ~600 hp and are immune (1 dmg at most) to physical attacks. if they are not killed they will be consumed in 3 turns to give him an undispellable insanely high damage buff. They are also immune to marein. For reference, ~410 magic power + lvl 1 malefic wind is enough to kill them.
        - Dissipate his damage reduction buff (Maporfic) ASAP, otherwise he takes 0 physical dmg. He always casts Maporfic as first action.
        - If you get frozen, he will be more likely to attack the frozen unit with a physical skill and instant kill them. As such, dumping damage on him is not recommended. 
        - He either has hp thresholds per phase (he doesnt take damage past an amount per hidden phase) or has some strange hp mechanic.
        - He may counter with Madalto or Labadios every time he takes a certain amount of damage.
        - After 2-3 turns he will resummon the ghost kids, can prepare beforehand with mental unity. 
        - It is recommended to have at least 2 healing capable users and 2 AOE magic users.
        - A knight with knight's defense + synced ASPD helps survive dubious rounds.
        - Very very resistant to debuffs (in most cases just straight up immune).

8. After defeating him. Follow Iris to the well. Reverse the nullstone blocking the way previously and head deep into the well. You will find the priest's remains crystallized with several children. You learn that the crystallization was the priest's own Wizardry magic that he used to reduce the suffering of children. After reversing his body, you experience his human memories and watch his body fade away. You can pick up a Godefroi Holy Relic on the floor. Head to the purple crystal in the back and exhaust both options. Iris insists that you take part of the canary crystal. When you exit the well, Iris musters the courage to push on ahead by herself, and you will receive her as a bondmate. You can now return to the Royal Capital and turn in the request. After another extremely long summary cutscene, you will wake up to Lulunarde commending you on how heroic you are. Thanks Lulunarde.

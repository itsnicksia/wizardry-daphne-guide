# Deepsnow Hinterlands of Isberg - Important Request and Greater Warped One

## Main Story Request Walkthrough:

!!! note "An interesting feature for this Abyss is that there are footprints left in the snow. Both the MC and enemies that are not detected yet produce these footprints, so these are good indicators of where the enemy is if you cannot see them but hear them."

1. Head to Royal Capital Adventurer's Guild to receive your faction request of choice.
2. Head over to Valeon Grasslands and walk through all three plains. You'll occasionally encounter some NPC dialogues about Isberg on the way, and eventually get a short briefing from your faction representaive.
3. Deepsnow Hinterlands of Isberg's main town, Winterface Settlement, will not having of interest. To continue, head to the edge of town and enter the Abyss. You will be introduced to the chill/freezing mechanic along with the main gimmick of this abyss, which are portions of the map that inflict chill per turn and deny use of the minimap and map. Eventually you'll also reach a hot spring that can cleanse you of the chill/freeze debuff. Continue to Route 2.

    !!! item "Freeze Mechanic"
        - In applicable areas, snowstorm will take place at the start of turn, immediately applying 8 stacks of chill on every unit on the field.
        - When chill reaches 0, applies frozen to the unit.
        - Frozen unit can still act, but will have greatly reduced ASPD, ACC, and EVA. Frozen units can get shattered, which removes Frozen but inflicts a large amount of damage. Only actions can do this (Fire elemental actions, Two-handed weapon actions, etc).
        - Snowstorm reduces chill by 2 every turn, while water element skills reduce chill by 3. Some unique enemy skills can immediately reduce chill by large amounts.
        - Hot Springs and Camping can immediately remove all chill/frozen debuffs. Ice-Chipping Hammers are consumables that can also remove chill and freeze from a single unit.
        - Some equipment reduces chill stack reduction.

5. While going through Route 2, there will be a few cutscenes foreshadowing the upcoming fight on this floor. Upon reaching the end of the floor, you'll engage in a fight with Bigfoot.
  
    !!! danger "Bigfoot"
        - He will start with Empowered by Snowstorm then immediately cast Hip Attack to a random adventurer. He has two baby bigfoots to his sides.
        - Like with many enemies in this abyss, he will cast skills out of turn when taking a certain amount of damage.
        - When taking a certain amount of damage, he will immediately cast his breath skill. The second time, he will chest pount and summon more baby bigfoots. The third time he will self buff with 10 turns of DEF, MDEF, and ATK up. The ATK is dispelled first.
        - Fire attacks will enrage him and can cause him to immediately cast his breath skill. However, fire attacks used after he self buffs will instead remove all his buffs and cause him to cast an undispellable infinite ATK UP and CT UP buff.
        - If Bigfoot is killed before all the baby bigfoots, the rest will be severely ATK debuffed and CT downed.
        
6. Enter Rockhome Village, which is seemingly empty. There is some information that can be obtained in the mayor's house right next to the Harken. If you return to town via the Harken at this point, you will receive the Faction-specific side-quest. You may go complete the request now or later. If later, continue onwards to Route 4.
7. While going through Route 4, you'll be introduced to another gimmick in this abyss, which is the Nullshadow. You also meet Iris, who is a main character for this abyss. She will save you once from the Nullshadow. Continue to Route 5.

    !!! item "Nullshadow Mechanic"
        - Whenever in a snowstorm area, there will be a chance the Nullshadow spawns nearby. It is a white ghostly version of the Greater Warped One of this abyss. There will be a sound cue whenever it shows up.
        - It is an unkillable enemy that typically casts Labadios on your team, typically dealing insane amounts of damage that drops HP to 1. If hit again while at 1 HP, it will kill the adventurer.
        - You will need to flee from the fight if you accidentally engage with the Nullshadow, as it's a guaranteed loss. It is very difficult to flee from the fight however, so it's recommended to not get into battle in the first place.
        - When you flee from the fight or leave the snowstorm area, it will despawn.

8. While going through Route 5, you will eventually get caught by the Nullshadow again. You will be stuck in a looping room with various spawned enemies and the Nullshadow. However, your character is getting very sleepy and the situation looks very dire. Lulunarde will mention how the snowstorm is making things very difficult and that it has something to do with trees blocking the wind. This scripted scenario will have your character constantly falling over and Lulunarde constantly waking you up. This scenario is similar to the drowning scenario in Abyss 2, where you will learn the Cursed Hand Technique for the Abyss in order to survive. There will be a tree stump in the center of the small room, where you must tap on it to revive the tree and stop the snowstorm. When the snowstorm subsides, the Nullshadow will also despawn. Proceed to Route 6.

9. During your trek through Route 6, you will notice a lot of berry bushes that cannot be interacted with. It's ideal to note their location (or just look at the provided map). Upon going further, you'll eventually officially meet Iris, who is reluctant to talk to you. Upon exhausting the dialogue options, you'll be tasked with helping her collect snowberries. Return to all the snowberry bushes indicated and pick them. Each bush randomly can either give you a snowberry, give a half-eaten one, or trigger a fight. There will a fight where the snowberry is on the floor nearby, and another where the fight gives a snowberry directly. Upon gathering enough, head back and turn in the snowberries to Iris to gain her trust. As you continue towards the mine however, you'll eventually by surrounded by wolves. You'll need to kill the head wolf to progress.

    !!! danger "Snow Wolf Leader"
        - The fight has several other snow wolves in the same row and behind. The snow wolves are significantly weaker than the leader.
        - The wolves can summon another wolf into the fight, while the leader can summon multiple into the fight.
        - The leader can use an ice breath that immediately freezes a row. He can also summon an ice storm that also freezes everyone in the battle.
        - When he takes a certain amount of damage, he can immediately cast Glacial Storm, which is a very strong AOE on the whole team. This damage is high enough to one-shot most adventurers.
        - When he is about to die, he will summon an extremely large amount of snow wolves.
        - When the leader dies, all the remaining snow wolves will be greatly debuffed in attack and CT.

11. Route 7 is a Mineshaft where you'll eventually meet Nero. Gain his trust by helping him with his task of collecting ore on Route 8. Head downstairs using the stairs nearby and you'll be introduced to a small mechanic of this floor. The ores are located on the provided map. One is guarded by a Scorpion Lady + Hydra Plant + Desert Insects and the other is guarded by two Hydra Plants + Clouds + Desert Insects.

    !!! item "Poison Gas Mechanic"
        - Poison gas may initially be on the floor. Typically to clear it, you'll need to reverse the rockfall nearby.
        - However, rockfalls with no poison gas nearby can SOMETIMES generate poison gas. (consult map)
        - Poison gas tiles act effectively the same as a poison tile.

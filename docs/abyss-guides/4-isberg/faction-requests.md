## Blizzard Blocking the Path

### Witch Hunt in Elden Hill Village (1st Faction Request)

##### Overview 

The faction requests are unlocked after entering Route 4 for the first time. The objectives of each faction are slightly different, but they all focus on stopping the witch burnings in Elden Hill Village and identifying the underlying cause. 

- Upon returning to Isberg a messenger will ask you to return to Royal Capital Luknalia
- Go to the Guild, speak with Arna, and accept the invitation
- If you leave immediately, then to accept the request in the future select "Talk" in the Guild
- All of the faction requests take place in Elden Hill Village and share the same map  

??? warning "Important Notes"

    === "Faction Affinity"
    
        - Supporting a faction in a previous Abyss influences certain outcomes 
        - Max faction affinity requires selecting that faction in the Cursed Wheel for Abyss 2 and 3
        - Max faction affinity is mandatory for the Best endings, 2 Guiding Lights (Luck), unique Calm Wind gear, and extra junk rewards
        - Faction affinity is denoted with a <span style="color: MediumOrchid">*</span>
    
            !!! note "Set max faction affinity in the Cursed Wheel before starting to avoid potentially having to redo an ending" 
    
    === "Endings" 

        Overview
        
        - 10 unique endings across all factions have been identified 
        - Some endings may have been missed as of 1/1 
        - Known endings are sufficient for unlocking the 2 Guiding Lights (Luck)
        - Princess faction is listed with 4 endings as the Best ending has 2 distinct sub-endings with different rewards and scenes 
    
        Endings per Faction
    
        - Princess: 4 
        - Pontiff: 3
        - Admiral: 3
        - Total: 10 

    === "Reset Request" 
    
        - Deepsnow Hinterlands Entrance > Blizzard Blocking the Path (Route 4 entrance) > Exit via Route 3 Harken
        - Deepsnow Hinterlands Entrance > Minor Harken Beyond the Blizzard (Route 5 Harken) > Exit via nearby Harken
        - Note: The 1st faction request is technically first unlocked when you enter Route 3 for the first time. However, it can only be reset using the Route 4 or 5 Cursed Wheel node. It is in your best interest to reach one of those two floors if you plan to do all of the endings before progressing with the main story

    === "Unlock Conditions" 

        !!! warning "Friendly warning in advance that 1) the unlock conditions are likely bugged and 2) the process can be time-consuming and frustrating." 

        What is going on?
                
        - The main issue is Discord members have reported wildly inconsistent unlocking conditions. 
        - As of 1/3/26 we have confirmed that there is only 1 Guiding Light (Luck) tied to the 1st faction requests. 
        - The problem is that for some members it only unlocks _after_ clearing the 3rd or 4th GWO fight. For others it's been unlocked on their first run before the GWO is ever encountered. 
        - Clearing the 4th GWO fight has been giving a Guiding Light (Luck) consistently, so that does not appear to be bugged.  
        - Until this is addressed all we can do is list the conditions that have been reported as "working". These might not work for you. 
        - It is also possible that this was shadow-patched at some point and is driving the inconsistencies between the older and newer reports. I have no idea.  
        - Remember to double-check that "max faction affinity" is set-up in your Cursed Wheel before you begin as it is a requirement. 
                
        Potential Unlock Conditions  
                
        - Any Best ending
        - All 3 Best endings (Note: This is likely the the intended condition)
        - Clear the 4th GWO fight + do each Best Ending until it appears

    === "Confirmed"
    
        - Max faction affinity is required 
        - A Guiding Light will dissolve if it's already been received 
        - The 2nd faction quests do not have a Guiding Light that has been found even with all 3 "best" ending. They also have nothing to do with unlocking the 1st faction request Guiding Light, so please do not waste your valuable gaming time testing to see if that does anything.

    === "Contact" 
    
        - Please DM or ping @lightbearer on the Discord if you can confirm or provide additional information.

- A demonic brazier blocks entry to the witch's room until you have made a certain number of offerings. However, each time you return to town for an offering an innocent person is burned.  

??? warning "Mechanics" 

    ??? note "Demonic Brazier"

        === "Process"
            
            - Interact with the brazier and it will request an offering
            - Collect the offering via fighting enemies or returning to town 
            - Give the offering to the brazier to unlock a nearby door 
            - Investigate the unlocked area until Lulu makes a comment 
            - Return to the brazier for a new offering request 
            - Repeat until the witch's door is unlocked
            - On a subsequent run you can speak with Tenet in town to reduce the total number of offering requests
        
        === "Offering Requests"
        
            - Request 1 - 3 Rabbits - Defeat 3 different enemy groups with vorpal bunnies
            - Request 2 - Hen - Return to town and speak with Tenet
            - Request 3 - Living Blood - Defeat 2 different enemy groups with "monsters" (magical-beast, demi-human)
            - Request 4 - Infant (Lamb) - Return to town and speak with Tenet

        Basics
    
        - Returning to town for an offering results in a witch burning

        Elencia's Status 
        
        - Witness 0-3 witch burnings = Elencia Alive
        - Witness 4+ witch burnings = Elencia Dead
        - Requirement for triggering a witch burning scene is unclear. Based on limited testing:
            - Number of battles and/or 
            - Returning to town after giving an offering, but _before_ accepting the next brazier request

                - Junk is not rewarded if any witch burnings are witnessed
                - Full gold reward is always given

        === "What Ending Should I Do First?"
        
            If you plan to do all 3 endings:
            
            - Bad Ending - Elencia Dead as all 5 brazier offering requests are required on a first run
                - Returning to town only for the brazier offerings results in 3 witch burnings = Elencia Alive
                - An extra step is required. You must return to town an additional time after giving the brazier 3 Rabbits or Living Blood to see a 4th witch burning = Elincia Dead 
            - Select the Sheep from Tenent in town for the other 2 endings (Good, Best)
                - The Sheep immediately unlocks the witch's door, ensures 0 deaths, and Elencia will be alive after the boss fight
            
            If you only want the Guiding Light (Luck): 
            
            - Best Ending - Elencia Alive - "Condemn the Witch"

            <br></br>
            - Enter the Witch's Cave 
            - Complete all 5 brazier offering requests
                - Returning to town for only the offering requests results in 3 witch burnings and Elencia will be alive after the boss fight
                - This is not the outcome we want as Elencia must be dead. You must make an additional trip back to town to witness a 4th witch burning 
                - Return to town after offering the 3 Rabbits or Living Blood and exploring the unlocked room; but, do _not_ accept the next brazier request
            - When returning to the brazier with the Sheep additional enemies will spawn ("ROAR") in the B2F hallway

                - Witch (Humanoid) in the backrow and 2 Evil Eyes (Magical Being) in the frontrow 
                - The fight presents itself as a standard DPS race - kill the Witch before she wipes out your entire party with LA- spells. In reality it is a "gimmick" fight that requires understanding the Witch's AI behavior.

                    - Opens with a non-turn action that applies Batilgref to the front row
                    - If she takes any damage, then she will begin a cycle of using Mentual Unity twice followed by a LA- spell that will likely kill multiple units, especially if a Type (element) advantage is present
                    - If she takes no damage, then she will cast a debuff or status affliction followed by a MA- spell
                    - If she casts Katino (sleep), then she will use a MA- spell on that same row
                    - If she casts Dilto (ACC down), then she will use the MA- spell on either row  
    
                - Evil Eyes
                    - HP: ~12,000 
                    - These enemies behave exactly like their Abyss 3 (Corrosion Eye) counterparts, but with slightly elevated stats
                    - Laser Eye attack hits an entire row for physical damage that can be evaded 
                    - Single-target laser can hit any unit for physical damage 
                    - Can Skill- or Spell- Bind a single target 
                    - Can Petrify a single target 

            === "Low-level Strategy" 

                - Recommended units: 3 DPS, 2 Priests, 1 Knight
                - The key to the fight is to not attack the Witch - at all - until the Evil Eyes are dead
                - Use only single-target or row attacks on the Evil Eyes
                - Fighters
                    - Earth-Splitting Strike (level 62), Heavy Attack 3-5, or Decisive Torso Strike 1-3 can do respectable damage
                    - Full Power Strike (FPS) is powerful, but risky since the Evil Eyes could Skill-bind that unit before they act
                - Priests
                    - Bringing 2 Priests is recommended since you will need to remove debuffs with Abit (ideally, Abit 2, Daniel's potential inherit) and recover from row attacks with Madios
                    - If any of your DPS are cross-classed with Priest (MC, Abenius, Bugen, Gerulf, etc.) they can also spot heal (put a 2H staff in their inventory) or help clear debuffs, especially Batilgref 
                - Once the Evil Eyes are dead it is critical to kill the Witch as quickly as possible with FPS or your strongest attacks before she begins her cycle of 2x Mentual Unity into a LA- spell. If you brought Yuzaki now is the time to use Hue 1-3   
                - If you cannot kill her in 1 round, then: 
                    - Bring a Knight and use Knight's Defense to reduce her spell damage by 50%; make sure they move last in your turn order
                    - Cortu spell + Cortu scroll stack for additional spell damage mitigation
                    - MC's Chrono 1-2 from the Well of the Mind can serve as an emergency button to push her back in the turn order and give additional breathing room 

            === "1-Round Kill Strategy" 

                - Requirements
                    - Level 70
                    - +20 Silver/Ebon bows or 2H spears 
                    - High-level skills (Heavy Attack 5-7, Decisive Torso Strike 3-5, Hue 3-5, All-Out Strike, Shedding etc.)
                - The Witch has extremely low HP (~8,000) and can be killed with ranged weapons if your team is sufficiently powerful
                - The goal is maximum damage. You can bring 5 DPS + 1 Priest or 6 DPS + recovery items to deal with the 2 Evil Eyes afterwards 
                - The downside of bringing Yuzaki is that while Hue 3-5 is powerful it may not hit the Witch at all, but is useful for killing the Evil Eyes
                - If you do not have highly leveled skills, then it is possible to kill her with multiple Fighters using All-Out Strike
                - Speed strats like using Chrono 1-2, Shedding, Porto, Batilgref, etc. are less useful since it is likely the Witch will get at least 1 LA- spell off before they go into effect on the next turn

##### Admiral Route

- The Admiral's goal is to stop the witch hunts at the request of the elven Kinlord and his representative, Elinas, whose territory is adjacent to Elden Hill Village.
- To put an end to the witch burnings Pickerel suggests finding a "true" witch, threatening the local cleric to bring in the Cathedral Church, or sedating the villagers.   

??? warning "Mechanics"

    ??? note "Note on Initial Choices" 
    
        - The Admiral route is deceptively structured as the initial choices of "Capture a witch" or "Threaten" have no impact on the ending
        - The number of brazier requests determines whether Elencia is alive or dead after the boss fight
        - Elencia's post-battle status (dead or alive) determines the ending
        - The "Prepare Sedative" option is self-contained and separate from the brazier offerings mechanic

        === "Process"
    
            - Interact with the brazier and it will request an offering
            - Collect the offering via fighting enemies or returning to town 
            - Give the offering to the brazier to unlock a nearby door 
            - Investigate the unlocked area until Lulu makes a comment 
            - Return to the brazier for a new offering request 
            - Repeat until the witch's door is unlocked
            - On a subsequent run you can speak with Elinas in town to reduce the total number of offering requests
    
        === "Offering Requests"
        
            - Request 1:  3 Rabbits - Defeat 3 different enemy groups with vorpal bunnies
            - Request 2:  Broom - Return to town and speak with Elinas

            Fights 
            
            - Fight 1:  2 Big Slime (front); Evil Eye (back)
            - Fight 2:  Greater Demon and Lesser Demon (front); 2 Succubus (back)
            - Fight 3:  3 Bigfoot Child (front); Bigfoot (back)

        === "Boss: Witch"

            === "Mechanics" 

                - Witch (Humanoid) in the backrow and 2 Evil Eyes (Magical Being) in the frontrow 
                - The fight presents itself as a standard DPS race - kill the Witch before she wipes out your entire party with LA- spells. In reality it is a "gimmick" fight that requires understanding the Witch's AI behavior. 
    
                - Witch 
                    - HP: ~8,000
                    - Opens with a non-turn action that applies Batilgref to the front row
                    - If she takes any damage, then she will begin a cycle of using Mentual Unity twice followed by a LA- spell that will likely kill multiple units, especially if a Type (element) advantage is present
                    - If she takes no damage, then she will cast a debuff or status affliction followed by a MA- spell
                    - If she casts Katino (sleep), then she will use a MA- spell on that same row
                    - If she casts Dilto (ACC down), then she will use the MA- spell on either row  
    
                - Evil Eyes
                    - HP: ~12,000 
                    - These enemies behave exactly like their Abyss 3 (Corrosion Eye) counterparts, but with slightly elevated stats
                    - Laser Eye attack hits an entire row for physical damage that can be evaded 
                    - Single-target laser can hit any unit for physical damage 
                    - Can Skill- or Spell- Bind a single target 
                    - Can Petrify a single target 

            === "Low-level Strategy" 

                - Recommended units: 3 DPS, 2 Priests, 1 Knight
                - The key to the fight is to not attack the Witch - at all - until the Evil Eyes are dead
                - Use only single-target or row attacks on the Evil Eyes
                - Fighters
                    - Earth-Splitting Strike (level 62), Heavy Attack 3-5, or Decisive Torso Strike 1-3 can do respectable damage
                    - Full Power Strike (FPS) is powerful, but risky since the Evil Eyes could Skill-bind that unit before they act
                - Priests
                    - Bringing 2 Priests is recommended since you will need to remove debuffs with Abit (ideally, Abit 2, Daniel's potential inherit) and recover from row attacks with Madios
                    - If any of your DPS are cross-classed with Priest (MC, Abenius, Bugen, Gerulf, etc.) they can also spot heal (put a 2H staff in their inventory) or help clear debuffs, especially Batilgref 
                - Once the Evil Eyes are dead it is critical to kill the Witch as quickly as possible with FPS or your strongest attacks before she begins her cycle of 2x Mentual Unity into a LA- spell. If you brought Yuzaki now is the time to use Hue 1-3   
                - If you cannot kill her in 1 round, then: 
                    - Bring a Knight and use Knight's Defense to reduce her spell damage by 50%; make sure they move last in your turn order
                    - Cortu spell + Cortu scroll stack for additional spell damage mitigation
                    - MC's Chrono 1-2 from the Well of the Mind can serve as an emergency button to push her back in the turn order and give additional breathing room 

            === "1-Round Kill Strategy" 

                - Requirements
                    - Level 70
                    - +20 Silver/Ebon bows or 2H spears 
                    - High-level skills (Heavy Attack 5-7, Decisive Torso Strike 3-5, Hue 3-5, All-Out Strike, Shedding etc.)
                - The Witch has extremely low HP (~8,000) and can be killed with ranged weapons if your team is sufficiently powerful
                - The goal is maximum damage. You can bring 5 DPS + 1 Priest or 6 DPS + recovery items to deal with the 2 Evil Eyes afterwards 
                - The downside of bringing Yuzaki is that while Hue 3-5 is powerful it may not hit the Witch at all, but is useful for killing the Evil Eyes
                - If you do not have highly leveled skills, then it is possible to kill her with multiple Fighters using All-Out Strike
                - Speed strats like using Chrono 1-2, Shedding, Porto, Batilgref, etc. are less useful since it is likely the Witch will get at least 1 LA- spell off before they go into effect on the next turn

The faction requests are unlocked after entering Route 9 for the first time. The objective is to search for traces of two missing people and to discover why the faction called upon you, the Masked Adventurer, instead of employing their own members.

    11. Reverse the nullstone and head into the Bigfoot Cave. You will need to make your way to the very last room on the bottom right. 
    12. There will be a Bigfoot boss blocking your way. The fight has the Bigfoot Elder with 1 Baby Bigfoot in the front, and 2 Baby Bigfoot in the back. All of the babies can move twice a turn. After the Bigfoot Elder takes a certain amount of damage, he will Pound Chest and resummon any dead Baby Bigfoot. If any Baby Bigfoot are revived in this manner, they will immediately throw a snowball at a random teammate. From this point on, the Bigfoot Elder will repeatedly Pound Chest will taking any damage, so it's recommended to kill him first before all the babies.
    13. Look into the pile of poop in the next room. The second person you're looking for has red hair.
    14. Bring the head back to the Royal Capital and complete the request.
    15. Reward - Gem of Org x50 (one-time only), 30,000 Gold, Giant Beast Ape Heavy Armor, and Elliot, the Lamenting Broth (Attack Power) as a bondmate.

    9. From the Route 7 Harken go left and exit to Route 9. Find the tablet at:
        - (X:1, Y:7) - Upper left-hand side of the first house in the grass 
    10. Return to the Route 7 Harken and select Route 9. From the Route 9 Harken go to Route 10. Find the tablets in this order:

    11. Reverse the nullstone and head into the Bigfoot Cave. You will need to make your way to the very last room on the bottom right.
    12. There will be a Bigfoot boss blocking your way. The fight has the Bigfoot Elder by themselves. After taking a certain amount of damage, they will begin self-buffing. Each buff lasts 10 turns, and can knock previous buffs off (3 buff limit). Alternatively, you can dissipate the buffs yourself.
    13. This is the point where the endings diverge. 
    14. Look into the pile of poop in the next room. 
        - Selecting "Agnes is not here" leads to the "best" ending where you receive the bondmate
        - Selecting any head leads to the default ending
    15. If you selected:
        - "Agnes is not here", then go to the nullstone, reverse it, and type "Noah" into the prompt and then exit
        -  Any of the heads, then exit 
        - Using a Hook of Harken seems to be bugged, so it is strongly suggested that you manually walk to the exit 
    16. Head back to the Royal Capital to turn in the request. Sir William will leave for the nullstone. 
    17. Reward - Gem of Org x50 (one-time only), 30,000 Gold, and a Giant Beast Ape Robe.
    18. If you selected "Agnes is not here" and did NOT bring back a head, then return to the nullstone in the Bigfoot Cave for a scene to learn the truth about Agnes's fate. After the cutscene you will receive William, the Remorseful Husband (Divine Power) as a bondmate.

## Blizzard Blocking the Path

### Witch Hunt in Elden Hill Village (1st Faction Request)

#### Overview 

The faction requests are unlocked after entering Route 4 for the first time. The objectives of each faction are slightly different, but they all focus on stopping the witch burnings in Elden Hill Village and identifying the underlying cause. 

- Upon returning to Isberg a messenger will ask you to return to Royal Capital Luknalia
- Go to the Guild, speak with Arna, and accept the invitation
- If you decline, then to accept the request in the future select "Talk" in the Guild
- All of the faction requests take place in Elden Hill Village and share the same map  

??? warning "Important Notes"

    === "Faction Affinity"
    
        - Supporting a faction in a previous Abyss influences certain outcomes 
        - Max faction affinity requires selecting that faction in the Cursed Wheel for Abyss 2 and 3
        - Max faction affinity is mandatory for the Best endings, Guiding Light (Luck), unique Calm Wind gear, and extra junk rewards
        - Faction affinity is denoted with a <span style="color: MediumOrchid">*</span>
    
            !!! note "Set max faction affinity in the Cursed Wheel before starting to avoid potentially having to redo an ending" 
    
    === "Endings" 

        - Overview
        
            - 10 unique endings across all factions have been identified 
            - Known endings are sufficient for unlocking the Guiding Light (Luck)
            - The Princess faction is listed with 4 endings as the Best ending has 2 distinct sub-endings with different rewards and scenes 
    
        - Endings per Faction
    
            - Princess: 4 
            - Pontiff: 3
            - Admiral: 3
            - Total: 10 

    === "How to Reset Request" 
    
        - Deepsnow Hinterlands Entrance > Blizzard Blocking the Path (Route 4 entrance) > Exit via Route 3 Harken
        - Deepsnow Hinterlands Entrance > Minor Harken Beyond the Blizzard (Route 5 Harken) > Exit via nearby Harken
        
    === "Reset Notes"
    
        - When resetting the request you have to fully jump to Deepsnow Hinterlands Entrance, go back to the Ruins, and then jump again to Blizzard Blocking the Path or Minor Harken Beyond the Blizzard. The request will not reset if you simply wheel-in-place. 
        - The 1st faction request is technically first unlocked when you enter Route 3 for the first time. However, it can only be reset using the Route 4 or 5 Cursed Wheel node. It is in your best interest to reach one of those two floors if you plan to do all of the endings before progressing with the main story. 
    
??? tip "Guiding Light"

    === "Unlock Condition" 

        - As of 1/27 it seems as if the previous bugs have been fixed. 
        - The unlock condition is to get the Best ending for all 3 factions. 
        - Max affinity is required.
        - The Guiding Light will dissolve if it has already been received. 

    === "Bug Archive"
    
        This tab will be kept for the next month in case bugs appear again in the future. 
        
        What is going on?
                
        - The main issue is Discord members have reported wildly inconsistent unlocking conditions. 
        - As of 1/3/26 we have confirmed that there is only 1 Guiding Light (Luck) tied to the 1st faction requests. 
        - The problem is that for some members it only unlocks _after_ clearing the 3rd or 4th GWO fight. For others it's been unlocked on their first run before the GWO is ever encountered. 
        - Clearing the 4th GWO fight has been giving a Guiding Light (Luck) consistently, so that does not appear to be bugged.  
        - Until this is addressed all we can do is list the conditions that have been reported as "working". These might not work for you. 
        - It is also possible that this was shadow-patched at some point and is driving the inconsistencies between the older and newer reports. I have no idea.  
        - Remember to double-check that "max faction affinity" is set-up in your Cursed Wheel before you begin as it is a requirement. 
                
        Potential Unlock Conditions  
                
        - Any Best ending
        - All 3 Best endings (Note: This is likely the the intended condition)
        - Clear the 4th GWO fight + do each Best Ending until it appears
        - The Gamerch editors think that is achievement-based with a mix of Good and Best endings

    === "Contact" 
    
        - Please DM or ping @lightbearer on the Discord if you encounter any bugs or issues moving forward.

            - Interact with the brazier and it will request an offering
            - Collect the offering via fighting enemies or returning to town 
            - Give the offering to the brazier to unlock a nearby door 
            - Investigate the unlocked area until Lulu makes a comment 
            - Return to the brazier for a new offering request 
            - Repeat until the witch's door is unlocked
            - On a subsequent run you can speak with Tenet in town to reduce the total number of offering requests
        
        === "Offering Requests"
        
            - Request 1: 3 Rabbits - Defeat 3 different enemy groups with vorpal bunnies

        Basics

        - Witness 4+ witch burnings = Elencia Dead
        - Requirement for triggering a witch burning scene is unclear. Based on limited testing:
            - Number of battles and/or 
            - Returning to town after giving an offering, but before accepting the next brazier request

            - Rewards
                - Junk is not rewarded if any witch burnings are witnessed
                - Full gold reward is always given

        === "What Ending Should I Do First?"
        
            If you plan to do all 3 endings:
            
            - Bad Ending - Elencia Dead as all 5 brazier offering requests are required on a first run
                - Returning to town only for the brazier offerings results in 3 witch burnings = Elencia Alive
                - An extra step is required. You must return to town an additional time after giving the brazier 3 Rabbits or Living Blood to see a 4th witch burning = Elincia Dead 
            - Select the Sheep from Tenent in town for the other 2 endings (Good, Best)
                - The Sheep immediately unlocks the witch's door, ensures 0 deaths, and Elencia will be alive after the boss fight
            
            If you only want the Guiding Light (Luck): 
            
            - Best Ending - Elencia Alive - "Condemn the Witch"

            - Enter the Witch's Cave 
            - Complete all 5 brazier offering requests
                - Returning to town for only the offering requests results in 3 witch burnings and Elencia will be alive after the boss fight
                - This is not the outcome we want as Elencia must be dead. You must make an additional trip back to town to witness a 4th witch burning 
                - Return to town after offering the 3 Rabbits or Living Blood and exploring the unlocked room; but, do _not_ accept the next brazier request

                - Witch (Humanoid) in the backrow and 2 Evil Eyes (Magical Being) in the frontrow 
                - The fight presents itself as a standard DPS race - kill the Witch before she wipes out your entire party with LA- spells. In reality it is a "gimmick" fight that requires understanding the Witch's AI behavior.

                    - HP: ~8,000
                    - Opens with a non-turn action that applies Batilgref to the front row
                    - If she takes any damage, then she will begin a cycle of using Mentual Unity twice followed by a LA- spell that will likely kill multiple units, especially if a Type (element) advantage is present
                    - If she takes no damage, then she will cast a debuff or status affliction followed by a MA- spell
                    - If she casts Katino (sleep), then she will use a MA- spell on that same row
                    - If she casts Dilto (ACC down), then she will use the MA- spell on either row  
    
                - Evil Eyes
                    - HP: ~12,000 
                    - These enemies behave exactly like their Abyss 3 (Corrosion Eye) counterparts, but with slightly elevated stats
                    - Laser Eye attack hits an entire row for physical damage that can be evaded 
                    - Single-target laser can hit any unit for physical damage 
                    - Can Skill- or Spell- Bind a single target 
                    - Can Petrify a single target 

            === "Low-level Strategy" 

                - Recommended units: 3 DPS, 2 Priests, 1 Knight
                - The key to the fight is to not attack the Witch - at all - until the Evil Eyes are dead
                - Use only single-target or row attacks on the Evil Eyes
                - Fighters
                    - Earth-Splitting Strike (level 62), Heavy Attack 3-5, or Decisive Torso Strike 1-3 can do respectable damage
                    - Full Power Strike (FPS) is powerful, but risky since the Evil Eyes could Skill-bind that unit before they act
                - Priests
                    - Bringing 2 Priests is recommended since you will need to remove debuffs with Abit (ideally, Abit 2, Daniel's potential inherit) and recover from row attacks with Madios
                    - If any of your DPS are cross-classed with Priest (MC, Abenius, Bugen, Gerulf, etc.) they can also spot heal (put a 2H staff in their inventory) or help clear debuffs, especially Batilgref 
                - Once the Evil Eyes are dead it is critical to kill the Witch as quickly as possible with FPS or your strongest attacks before she begins her cycle of 2x Mentual Unity into a LA- spell. If you brought Yuzaki now is the time to use Hue 1-3   
                - If you cannot kill her in 1 round, then: 
                    - Bring a Knight and use Knight's Defense to reduce her spell damage by 50%; make sure they move last in your turn order
                    - Cortu spell + Cortu scroll stack for additional spell damage mitigation
                    - MC's Chrono 1-2 from the Well of the Mind can serve as an emergency button to push her back in the turn order and give additional breathing room 

            === "1-Round Kill Strategy" 

                - Requirements
                    - Level 70
                    - +20 Silver/Ebon bows or 2H spears 
                    - High-level skills (Heavy Attack 5-7, Decisive Torso Strike 3-5, Hue 3-5, All-Out Strike, Shedding etc.)
                - The Witch has extremely low HP (~8,000) and can be killed with ranged weapons if your team is sufficiently powerful
                - The goal is maximum damage. You can bring 5 DPS + 1 Priest or 6 DPS + recovery items to deal with the 2 Evil Eyes afterwards 
                - The downside of bringing Yuzaki is that while Hue 3-5 is powerful it may not hit the Witch at all, but is useful for killing the Evil Eyes
                - If you do not have highly leveled skills, then it is possible to kill her with multiple Fighters using All-Out Strike
                - Speed strats like using Chrono 1-2, Shedding, Porto, Batilgref, etc. are less useful since it is likely the Witch will get at least 1 LA- spell off before they go into effect on the next turn

??? warning "Mechanics"

    ??? note "Note on Initial Choices" 
    
        - The Admiral route is deceptively structured as the initial choices of "Capture a witch" or "Threaten" have no impact on the ending
        - The number of brazier requests determines whether Elencia is alive or dead after the boss fight
        - Elencia's post-battle status (dead or alive) determines the ending
        - The "Prepare Sedative" option is self-contained and separate from the brazier offerings mechanic    
    
    ??? note "Demonic Brazier Offerings"

            - Interact with the brazier and it will request an offering
            - Collect the offering via fighting enemies or returning to town 
            - Give the offering to the brazier to unlock a nearby door 
            - Investigate the unlocked area until Lulu makes a comment 
            - Return to the brazier for a new offering request 
            - Repeat until the witch's door is unlocked
            - On a subsequent run you can speak with Elinas in town to reduce the total number of offering requests
    
        === "Offering Requests"
        
            - Request 1:  3 Rabbits - Defeat 3 different enemy groups with vorpal bunnies
            - Request 2:  Broom - Return to town and speak with Elinas
            - Request 3:  Living Blood - Defeat 2 different enemy groups with "monsters" (magical-beast, demi-human)
            - Request 4:  Infant (Lamb) - Return to town and speak with Elinas
            - Request 5:  Gold Ore - Defeat 3 back-to-back groups of tough enemies 

        === "Elinas Offerings" 

            Basics 
            
            - Only available after a first run
            - Talk to Elinas in town before entering the Witch's Cave
            - Select 1 of the 2 offerings in advance, reducing the total number of brazier requests 
            
            Total Brazier Requests
            
            - Do not talk to Elinas: 5

        - Verified that the number of offerings still lead to the outcomes listed in the ending guides
        - The number of witch burning scenes witnessed do not seem to affect any of the endings, rewards, or dialogue

                    - This differs from the Princess route where the ending choices _do_ lead to modified sub-ending scenes and different rewards
                    - This could potentially be a bug or there is some combination of responses that has not yet been identified

            Fights 
            
            - Fight 1:  2 Big Slime (front); Evil Eye (back)

            - Fight 3:  3 Bigfoot Child (front); Bigfoot (back)

        === "Boss: Witch"

            === "Mechanics" 

                - Witch (Humanoid) in the backrow and 2 Evil Eyes (Magical Being) in the frontrow 
                - The fight presents itself as a standard DPS race - kill the Witch before she wipes out your entire party with LA- spells. In reality it is a "gimmick" fight that requires understanding the Witch's AI behavior. 
    
                - Witch 
                    - HP: ~8,000
                    - Opens with a non-turn action that applies Batilgref to the front row
                    - If she takes any damage, then she will begin a cycle of using Mentual Unity twice followed by a LA- spell that will likely kill multiple units, especially if a Type (element) advantage is present
                    - If she takes no damage, then she will cast a debuff or status affliction followed by a MA- spell
                    - If she casts Katino (sleep), then she will use a MA- spell on that same row
                    - If she casts Dilto (ACC down), then she will use the MA- spell on either row  
    
                - Evil Eyes
                    - HP: ~12,000 
                    - These enemies behave exactly like their Abyss 3 (Corrosion Eye) counterparts, but with slightly elevated stats
                    - Laser Eye attack hits an entire row for physical damage that can be evaded 
                    - Single-target laser can hit any unit for physical damage 
                    - Can Skill- or Spell- Bind a single target 
                    - Can Petrify a single target 

            === "Low-level Strategy" 

                - Recommended units: 3 DPS, 2 Priests, 1 Knight
                - The key to the fight is to not attack the Witch - at all - until the Evil Eyes are dead
                - Use only single-target or row attacks on the Evil Eyes
                - Fighters
                    - Earth-Splitting Strike (level 62), Heavy Attack 3-5, or Decisive Torso Strike 1-3 can do respectable damage
                    - Full Power Strike (FPS) is powerful, but risky since the Evil Eyes could Skill-bind that unit before they act
                - Priests
                    - Bringing 2 Priests is recommended since you will need to remove debuffs with Abit (ideally, Abit 2, Daniel's potential inherit) and recover from row attacks with Madios
                    - If any of your DPS are cross-classed with Priest (MC, Abenius, Bugen, Gerulf, etc.) they can also spot heal (put a 2H staff in their inventory) or help clear debuffs, especially Batilgref 
                - Once the Evil Eyes are dead it is critical to kill the Witch as quickly as possible with FPS or your strongest attacks before she begins her cycle of 2x Mentual Unity into a LA- spell. If you brought Yuzaki now is the time to use Hue 1-3   
                - If you cannot kill her in 1 round, then: 
                    - Bring a Knight and use Knight's Defense to reduce her spell damage by 50%; make sure they move last in your turn order
                    - Cortu spell + Cortu scroll stack for additional spell damage mitigation
                    - MC's Chrono 1-2 from the Well of the Mind can serve as an emergency button to push her back in the turn order and give additional breathing room 

            === "1-Round Kill Strategy" 

                - Requirements
                    - Level 70
                    - +20 Silver/Ebon bows or 2H spears 
                    - High-level skills (Heavy Attack 5-7, Decisive Torso Strike 3-5, Hue 3-5, All-Out Strike, Shedding etc.)
                - The Witch has extremely low HP (~8,000) and can be killed with ranged weapons if your team is sufficiently powerful
                - The goal is maximum damage. You can bring 5 DPS + 1 Priest or 6 DPS + recovery items to deal with the 2 Evil Eyes afterwards 
                - The downside of bringing Yuzaki is that while Hue 3-5 is powerful it may not hit the Witch at all, but is useful for killing the Evil Eyes
                - If you do not have highly leveled skills, then it is possible to kill her with multiple Fighters using All-Out Strike
                - Speed strats like using Chrono 1-2, Shedding, Porto, Batilgref, etc. are less useful since it is likely the Witch will get at least 1 LA- spell off before they go into effect on the next turn

## Short Rest in the Cabin

### Search for the Missing Persons (2nd Faction Request)

#### Overview 

The faction requests are unlocked after entering Route 9 for the first time. The objective is to search for traces of two missing people and to discover why the faction called upon you, the Masked Adventurer, instead of employing their own members. 

Upon entering the Royal Capital, the faction representative will appear to discuss the missing persons. 

- Agree to help twice when prompted
- Head to the Guild and accept the request under the Royal Capital tab 
- If you decline at any point the faction representative will not appear again and the Cursed Wheel must be reset

??? warning "Important Notes"

    ??? warning "Bondmate Ending Requirements"
    
        - Knowledge of [reversing nullstones](./important-request-gwo.md#saving-iris) (clear 3rd GWO fight)
        - Knowledge of [shortcuts](./important-request-gwo.md#learning-the-truth) to open the mine walls on Route 7 to speed up the search (optional)

    ??? note "Cursed Wheel Settings - First Run and Resets" 

        === "First Run"

            - Wheel to Deepsnow Hinterlands Entrance and go to the Ruins.
            - Wheel to Short Rest in the Cabin with the following toggles selected:
                - North Lakeshore Cabin - "Fixed it up"
                - Dwarves' Cave - Any 
                - Village Adults - "Did not encounter them"
                    - If the village adults have been captured, then the first body will be in poor condition and the request will end.
            - Double-check that all toggles are set correctly before wheeling because they have a tendency to automatically shift depending on the order you change them.

        === "Reset for 1st Body"

            - Wheel to Deepsnow Hinterlands Entrance and go to the Ruins
            - Wheel to Short Rest in the Cabin with the following toggles selected:
                - North Lakeshore Cabin - "Fixed it up"
                - Dwarves' Cave - Any
                - Village Adults - "Did not encounter them"
                - Search for the [Faction Missing Person] - "Did not take the request"

        === "Reset for 2nd Body"

            - Wheel to Deepsnow Hinterlands Entrance and go to the Ruins
            - Wheel to Short Rest in the Cabin with the following toggles selected:
                - North Lakeshore Cabin - "Fixed it up"
                - Dwarves' Cave - Any 
                - Village Adults - "Secured all of them"
                - Search for the [Faction Missing Person] - "The older brother's body was resurrected"

        === "Troubleshooting"

            - For any reset you must always start by wheeling back to Deepsnow Hinterlands Entrance. It clears all active flags and reduces the chance of a bug appearing, which is common when you have two requests active that share the same map.
            - Always double- or triple-check that the Cursed Wheel toggles are set correctly as they have a tendency to flip back to a default setting when changing multiple toggles at the same time.  
            - As a worst case option you can wheel to "Fresh Start" in Abyss 1 to clear any broken flags or bugs, but it will reset all of your map data.
            - Wheeling in place twice on Short Rest in the Cabin should open all the mine shortcuts if they were previously unlocked prior to defeating the GWO on your most recent clear

    ??? danger "Warning! Blind Runs" 
    
        - Strongly recommend NOT doing a blind run
        - The majority of the request is searching for interactable objects (white shiny stars) across multiple floors
        - Interactable objects are easy to miss in snowy environments, do not have sound cues, and often do not appear unless you are standing directly on its tile  

??? note "Bigfoot Cave"

    ??? note "Overview"
    
        - Location of the second missing person for all 3 faction requests
        - Requires knowledge of [reversing nullstones](./important-request-gwo.md#saving-iris) (clear 3rd GWO fight)
        - Map completion resets upon Cursed Wheeling
        - Mandatory Bigfoot boss fight that has a slightly different gimmick depending on the faction selected, strongly recommend bringing a Knight with All-Around Cover (level 67) 
        - Not a mob dense area during the request with few fights on the path to the boss's room 
        - Primary danger is being chilled or frozen before reaching the boss
        - Enemy level is 70
        - Enemies: Bigfoot, Bigfoot Child, Ice Cloud, Snow Slime, Abyssal Insects, Ice and Earth Entities

#### Princess Route 

??? note "Search for Missing Royal Knights"
    
    === "1st Body (Elliot)"
    
        - Accept the request at the Royal Capital Guild and return to Isberg.
            - Talk to the old lady NPC and pay 300 Gold. 
            - Go to the Inn, talk to the Innkeeper, and pay 300 Gold.
        - Go to Route 3, enter the Mayor's House, and obtain a faction-related helmet and the Rockhome Village Key. To avoid the spike traps return to the Harken, select Route 2, and re-enter Route 3.
        - Head north to the two locked houses on the bottom-left side of the map. 
            - Top house contains faction-related clothing and a body part. 
            - Left house contains an ambush after entering the storage area. Defeat all 6 Desert Insects and collect the faction-related insignia on the floor along with some Lulu text that this is not the correct body.
        - From the two houses head north, loop around to the east, and head south to the house located at the middle-bottom part of the map. You will encounter Mike, one of the village adults, and fight 3 goblins. Enter the house to find the body of the first missing Royal Knight in a cage.
        - Return to the Royal Capital Guild and hand over the body. The revived Royal Knight, Elliot, will share that his missing brother, Philip, likely left wax tablets as clues for him to follow in case they were ever separated.

            ??? note "Body Retrieval Troubleshooting"
                - If the body was too damaged to revive, then double-check that Short Rest in the Cabin - Village Adults is toggled to "Did not encounter them". When you first zone into Route 9 you should receive a pop-up with the request from Lulu. 
                - If the body cannot be collected, then the request was not accepted at the Royal Capital Guild.

    === "2nd Body (Philip)"

        - The second half of the request involves searching Routes 3, 7, 9, and 10 for wax tablets ("tablets"). 
        - The tablets appear as shiny, white interactables on the map. A few of them require standing directly on their tile to collect. They must be collected in the exact order listed otherwise the subsequent ones will not spawn.

            ??? note "Route 3"
            
                - Harken to Route 3 and find the tablets in this order: 
                    - (X:11, Y:25) - Northwest of the Harken on the ground by a tree
                    - (X:26, Y:24) - Few steps southeast of Route 4 entrance

                - If the body was too damaged to revive, then double-check that Short Rest in the Cabin - Village Adults is toggled to "Did not encounter them". When you first zone into Route 9 you should receive a pop-up with the request from Lulu. 
                - If the body cannot be collected, then the request was not accepted at the Royal Capital Guild.

    === "2nd Body (Laurent)"

        - The second half of the request involves searching Routes 3, 7, 9, and 10 for wax tablets ("tablets"). 
        - The tablets appear as shiny, white interactables on the map. A few of them require standing directly on their tile to collect. They must be collected in the exact order listed otherwise the subsequent ones will not spawn.

            ??? note "Route 3"
            
                - Harken to Route 2 and enter Route 3, then look for the tablets in this order:

            ??? note "Route 7"
            
                - If all the shorcuts are open and/or you have the shortcut ability, then Harken to Route 7 as you can collect all 5 tablets in one run. 
                - If the shortcuts are not open, then Harken to Route 6 and enter Route 7. Find the tablets in this order: 
                    - (X:13, Y:23) - Central 3x3 room 
                    - (X:16, Y:22) - Right-hand dead-end of 3x3 room
                - Return to the Route 6 Harken and select Route 7. Find the tablets in this order:

                    - (X:18, Y:19) - Northwest of the nullstone icon in a small (2x1) dead-end 
                - When finished return to the Route 7 Harken, go left, and exit to Route 9.

                - Find the tablet at:

                    ??? note "Tablet Troubleshooting"

                        - If there is no tablet on the nullstone, then one of them was missed on Route 10. 
                        - If you were missing a tablet and reversed the nullstone do the following steps: 
                            - Find the tablet you missed 
                            - Re-enter Route 10 and the tablet will spawn on the tile where the nullstone was collected
                        - If everything was done correctly, then you will receive Lulu text when you step on the pool of blood at the entrance otherwise the Bigfoot boss will not spawn.
                        
                - Reverse the nullstone and head into the Bigfoot Cave. You will need to make your way to the very last room on the bottom right.

                - Examine the pile of poop in the next room

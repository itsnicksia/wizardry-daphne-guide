!!! warning "Please bear with us as this page is under construction. More and more details will be added."

??? note "Requirements - Complete the Second Abyss for the first time and talk with Arna in the Royal Capital Adventurer's Guild."  
    Once the requirements are fulfilled a new tab, "Bounties", will appear in the Requests section of the Adventurer's Guild. Each town has its own set of bounties, which requires the player to find and defeat a specific enemy. Submitting a defeated bounty at the Guild will reward the player with gold and Bounty Medals to redeem for items at the Jeweler under Exchange > Bounty Medal. Each bounty provides Bounty Marks (one-time only) that serve as experience points to increase the player's Bounty Rank. The Bounty Rank ranges from 1-13 with higher ranks unlocking new bounties, adding new items to the Bounty Medal shop, and granting milestone rewards that can be viewed under the Bounty List > Check Rewards menu. 

!!! note "Note that some event locations can change due to some maps having layout variations, but events always stay fixed to their relative room location. See the [Map Variations](../../mechanics/map-variations.md) page for details. If your map doesn't match what is shown below refer to the appropriate Dungeon Guide Abyss map to see other possible locations."

## Farming Information

- It's possible to farm a specific bounty by cursed wheeling in place, typically to Triumphant Return
- There is no limit to the number of Bounty Medals you can farm
- It's possible for bounty monsters to spawn as a relic version. Note that relic monsters can only spawn in the first row
- It costs 45,000 points (40,500 with no ore) to buy out the respawning items in the shop every month.
- It's recommended to farm Veigar as he is always in a set location close to a Harken and easier to deal with than some other bounties. Alternatively, you can farm Peerless Scorpionesses.

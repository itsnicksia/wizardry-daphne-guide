# Guarda Fortress

!!! warning "Map Variations"
    - Many floors have tile variations (shifts and rotations) that are randomly rolled when using the Cursed Wheel. Certain actions and events can also reset the dungeon layout, and your maps may not perfectly match what is shown. 
    - Events and items always occur on the same tile set, but their location and orientation may be rotated, so look for similar features. See [Map Variations page](../../mechanics/map-variations.md).  

## Key Mechanics

??? note "Corruption"
    - Corruption is a central mechanic of this Abyss, with major changes depending on the level of Corruption.
    - Corruption is increased when your party enters the sight area of a Corruption Sentry.
    - Corruption cannot be decreased whilst in the Abyss, but can be changed by modifying Causality in the **Cursed Wheel**.

    ??? note "Corruption Effects"
        - **Fortress Appearance:** Slime becomes more prominent with high Corruption.
        - **Quest Availability:** Some quest-lines become unavailable as essential NPCs are driven insane or die as a result of high Corruption. This affects which endings are available.
        - **Monsters:** Different monsters spawn, with stronger monsters at lower Corruption. 
        - **Greater Warped One:** The Greater Warped One is much stronger at lower Corruption, gaining new abilities and increased damage and health.

        ??? note "How to tell corruption level based on the Duke's room:"
    
            ![](./img/corruption-levels.png)

??? note "Golems"
    - Golems walk forwards when activated, destroying traps, damaged walls, and sentries in their path until they reach a solid wall or door.
    - Golems are only available after defeating the Greater Warped One at least once.

### Saving the Duke

There are three routes to choose for the Gaurda Fortress Abyss:

1. Princess Pulgritte
2. Pontiff Leaufonde
3. Admiral Avare

You gain access to the Gaurda Fortress area once accepting the "Duke Ixion" request from the **Royal Capital Luknalia** Adventurer's Guild.

    ??? note "Sentry Types"
        - Combat Sentry: Necromancer and Skeletons

    ??? note "Combat Sentry"
        - Combat Sentries are dangerous enemy spawns that patrol around the map in short fixed routes.
        - Once spotted, you will be able to see their sight area highlighted in orange on the map.
        - Entering their sight area will cause the sentry to chase your party, however their movement is much slower than regular enemies.
        - These encounters can be challenging for the unprepared party, featuring new enemies such as the Cyclops, and more powerful versions of regular enemies with increased health and damage.

    ??? note "Corruption Sentry"
        - Entering the sight area of a Corruption Sentry will trigger a short cutscene and increase Corruption.
        - See [Corruption](#key-mechanics) for more information about Corruption Sentries.

    ??? note "Walkthrough 1st Run"
        1. Fight your way through B1F until you pass a Sentry to reach the **Minor Harken**. 
        2. Travel south from the Harken and descend the stairs to B2F.

    ??? note "Walkthrough 2nd Run and onwards"
        1. You can use the golem nearby to block the view of the Sentry.
        2. Continue as usual.

        - Combat Sentry: Necromancer and Skeletons

    ??? note "Walkthrough 1st Run"
        Navigate your way through the Pit Trap Puzzle to the final area of B3F.

        - This floor is full of hidden pit traps which will drop you into the floor below, B3F.
        - Fortunately this does not deal any damage to your party.
        - You will need to repeatedly trigger these traps to fall down to B3F and find stairs back to B2F.
        - In order to navigate to the exit, follow the paths marked on these maps:

            1. Red
            2. Orange
            3. Blue
            4. Green

        - The lever must be activated at the end of the Orange route to continue on the blue path.
        - The Harken is after the boss at the end of the Green route.

    ??? note "Walkthrough 2nd Run and onwards"
        1. This will be about the same, except the golems can be used to block the Corruption Sentry's line of view. The top golem is optional but the bottom golem is necessary to block the view of the sentry in the way.
        2. Continue as usual.

    ??? danger "Boss: Necrocore"
        After falling through B2F's final Pit Trap, you will land in the final area of B3F. Take a few steps north and you will encounter the first Boss Encounter of Guarda Fortress Abyss.

        - Race: Undead
        - Abilities: Instant-Death

        This undead horse is a more powerful version of the enemy found in Crucible Mausoleum, carrying a similar array of instant-death skills like "Spear of Doom".

    ??? note "Walkthrough 1st Run"
        - See Zone 2 Walkthrough 1st Run.

??? map "Zone 4 -Tunnel-"

        - Combat Sentry: Scorpion Queen + (3 Chimeras or 2 Banshees)
        - Combat Sentry: 2x Minotaurs + 1 Chimera

    ??? note "Walkthrough 1st Run"
        - Upon returning from this floor to town, the slum faction request will become available.
        - It should be a straight shot to the end of this floor. There is no need to enter through any one-way doors past the first room of this floor. There will be a lot of sentry patrols around the end of the floor, so be cautious about maneuvering as you get closer to the end.

    ??? note "Walkthrough 2nd Run and onwards"
        1. There is only 1 golem that is needed to be pushed in this map, and it's the bottom one of the two at the bottom of the map.
        2. Continue on as usual.

??? map "Zone 6 -Prehistoric Corridor B2F-"
    ![](./img/zone-6-complete.jpg)

        - Combat Sentry: Cyclops + 2-3 Banshees
        - Combat Sentry: Scorpion Queen + (3 Chimeras or 2 Banshees)
        - Combat Sentry: 2x Minotaurs + 1 Chimera

    ??? note "Walkthrough 1st Run"
        - There are three paintings on this floor that give key knowledge. The painting at the very end will not be available to view until the second run onwards. 
        - Alarm traps are introduced on this floor. Generally, they just spawn 1 or 2 hostile enemies nearby, but they can be easily avoided. The very last alarm trap on the floor before the Cross Intersection will spawn a Corruption Sentry that is unavoidable without the Right Hand power of this abyss.
        
    ??? note "Walkthrough 2nd Run and onwards"
        1. The concept of crushing alarm traps is introduced in this map. You need to crush the alarm trap near the end to prevent it from spawning the Corruption Sentry.
        2. Remember to view the painting near the end of the map.

??? map "Zone 7 -Prehistoric Corridor B1F-"
    ![](./img/zone-7-complete.jpg)

    ??? note "Enemies"
        - Combat Sentry: Cyclops + 2-3 Banshees
        - Combat Sentry: Scorpion Queen + (3 Chimeras or 2 Banshees)
        - Combat Sentry: 2x Minotaurs + 1 Chimera

    ??? note "Walkthrough 1st Run"
        - A somewhat difficult floor due to being a battle of attrition in saving resources to fight the floor boss. There is no need to enter any one-way doors and it's not necessary to step on any poison tiles on the first run through.

    ??? note "Walkthrough 2nd Run and onwards"
        1. The concept of crushing sentries is introduced on this map. You will need to do so to pass by the Corruption Sentry in the room with 6 Golems in two parallel lines.
        2. Near the end, you can skip the Doll boss entirely by crushing them with a Golem.

        ![](./img/golem-kill-boss.jpg)

    ??? danger "Boss: Doll"
        - Abilities: Charm, Confuse, MP Drain

        The doll is the first real wall of the Guarda Fortress abyss and can be very challenging, as it's purely RNG-based. She attacks twice in each turn, hits hard with single and row target attacks, has a full party charm that drains MP, and casts a confusion that targets three party members at random. She has approximately 11k HP and high evasion, so she's fairly squishy...if you're able to hit her.

        !!! note "Tips"
            - If you've been keeping yourself low level to maximize experience gains, you might consider leveling up to at least 55
            - Buy some Scrolls of Sedation in town for your damage dealers to cast REILIS and remove confusion
            - Cast BATILGREF on the doll to lower her evasion and slow her down
            - Stack KINAPIC from scrolls and your priest(s) to give both rows enhanced resistance
            - Remove confusion and charm with your damage dealers via scrolls so your healers can focus on that.
            - One viable strategy is to un-equip weapons from any physical DPS and have your main DPS be the slowest so that any faster teammates can cleanse their charm.

??? map "Zone 8 -Fortress 1F Entrance-"
    ![](./img/zone-8-complete.jpg)

    ??? note "Sentry Types"
        - Combat Sentry: Cyclops + (2 Succubus + 1 Vampire or 1 Minotaur + 1 Succubus)
        - Combat Sentry: 2 Vampires + 2 Succubus
        - Combat Sentry: 1 Greater Demon + 1 Minotaur

    ??? note "Walkthrough 1st Run (1st Half from Zone 8 to 9)"
        1. From this point onwards, there are no rest points until the Zone 9 Harken is reached. However, it is not as simple as walking from Zone 8 to Zone 9. It will be a walk from Zone 8 to Zone 10 and then falling down to the Zone 9 Harken. There is no need to walk through one-way doors.
        2. Luckily, you won't need to explore a whole floor each time but rather just small portions of each floor. It is recommended however to carry a lot of consumables before continuing, as the Sentries on this floor are a lot stronger than previous floors.

    ??? note "Walkthrough 1st Run (2nd Half from Zone 9 to Zone 8 back to Zone 9)"
        - You will drop down and the nearby door is blocked by corruption. Ignore this for now and continue onwards. You're forced to pass by a Corruption Sentry in the bottom left of the map.

    ??? note "Walkthrough 2nd Run and onwards (1st Half from Zone 8 to 9)"
        - There is not much difference from the 1st run, you simply walk through as usual. There will be a demonstration of using the Right Hand Reversal mechanic to use Golems to step on buttons near the end of this half.

    ??? note "Walkthrough 2nd Run and onwards (2nd Half from Zone 9 to Zone 8 back to Zone 9)"
        1. When dropping down this time, the room that was previously blocked by corruption is now open. You must go into this room to obtain the request for saving Liam. There is also a rag in this room that triggers a Corruption Sentry if obtained, but is necessary for saving Liam unharmed. You can Cursed Wheel away the corruption stack from this encounter.          2. In addition, you can use the Right Hand Reversal mechanic to bypass the Corruption Sentry in the bottom left of the map.

??? map "Zone 9 -Fortress 2F Entrance-"
    ![](./img/zone-9-complete.jpg)

    ??? note "Enemies"
        - Combat Sentry: Cyclops + (2 Succubus + 1 Vampire or 1 Minotaur + 1 Succubus)
        - Combat Sentry: 2 Vampires + 2 Succubus
        - Combat Sentry: 1 Greater Demon + 1 Minotaur'

    ??? note "Walkthrough 1st Run (1st Half from Zone 9 to Zone 10)"
        - There may be a room that will lock behind you on this floor. There is a rotating sentry and corruption sentry inside. You will need to get seen by the corruption sentry to access the door with the switch that opens the door out of this room. Otherwise it will be straightforward.

    ??? note "Walkthrough 1st Run (2nd Half from Zone 8 to Zone 10)"
        - Similar to the 1st Half depending on map generation.

    ??? note "Walkthrough 2nd Run and onwards (Both Halves)"
        - The trap room that previously locked you in with a corruption sentry can be solved now. This room may show up on either half of this floor.

        ![](./img/golem-answer-9.jpg)

??? map "Zone 10 -Fortress 3F Lord's Room-"
    ![](./img/zone-10-complete.jpg)
    
    If your corruption level is not too high, you will find the Duke's party on this floor.

    ??? note "Enemies"
        - Combat Sentry: Cyclops + (2 Succubus + 1 Vampire or 1 Minotaur + 1 Succubus)
        - Combat Sentry: 2 Vampires + 2 Succubus
        - Combat Sentry: 1 Greater Demon + 1 Minotaur

    ??? note "Walkthrough 1st Run (1st Half Zone 9 to Zone 10 to Zone 9)"
        - It's a relatively chill walk to the top middle room. You are forced to trigger a Corruption Sentry while passing by. Upon reaching the top middle room, you'll need to drop down via a hole on the bottom left of the room. This drop you into the sight of the Corruption Sentry, but right outside of the Zone 9 Harken.

    ??? note "Walkthrough 1st Run (2nd Half Straight to the Duke)"
        - There is a fountain to heal up at before heading to the final room. There are a lot of sentry patrols on this floor, but they can all be avoided by carefully tailing behind them. The statue rooms are not relevant on the 1st run but can be used to hide from the sentries if you get seen. After arriving at the final room, you can begin the GWO fight by interacting with the lever further down from the room.

    ??? note "Walkthrough 2nd Run and onwards (1st Half Zone 9 to Zone 10 to Zone 9)"
        1. The Corruption Sentry in this path can be avoided now. You will need to do the puzzle that is initiated by pushing the golem in the room nearby through the wall. There will be a skeleton on the floor that needs to be interacted with, which will then spawn a doll and map on the floor nearby. The map will mark 3 locations on the previous two floors that you will need to backtrack to in order to pick up wind-up keys for the doll automaton. The 3 locations will always be the same regardless of map configuration. After obtaining 3 wind-up keys, return to the doll in the Zone 10 room and interact with it. Afterwards, walk to the tile right outside of the Corruption Sentry's sight.
            - Zone 9: X:7, Y:12
            - Zone 8: X:4, Y:9 | X:7, Y:19
        2. In the room before dropping down to the Corruption Sentry, you can open a different hole with a Golem so you don't get seen. 

            ![](./img/golem-answer-10-2.jpg)

    ??? note "Walkthrough 2nd Run and onwards (2nd Half straight to the Duke)"
        - It's generally the same this time. Depending on which ending run you are there may be different things to do though. You don't need to interact with the Lever this time and can just walk directly to the ramparts of the castle.
        
    ??? map "Path to boss"
        In order to reach the boss, you must circle around to the other side of the stone pillar and interact with it. Along the way, you will encounter one mandatory sentry battle and on your first run, you will encounter a second mandatory sentry battle during the dialog prompts.

# Guarda Fortress

!!! warning "Under Construction - thank you for your patience"

## Key Mechanics

??? note "Corruption"
    - Corruption is a central mechanic of this Abyss, with major changes depending on the level of Corruption.
    - Corruption is increased when your party enters the sight area of a Corruption Sentry.
    - Corruption cannot be decreased whilst in the Abyss, but can be changed by modifying Causality in the **Cursed Wheel**.

    ??? note "Corruption Effects"
        - **Fortress Appearance:** Slime becomes more prominent with high Corruption.
        - **Quest Availability:** Some quest-lines become unavailable as essential NPCs are driven insane or die as a result of high Corruption. This affects which endings are available.
        - **Monsters:** Different monsters spawn, with stronger monsters at lower Corruption. 
        - **Greater Warped One:** The Greater Warped One is much stronger at lower Corruption, gaining new abilities and increased damage and health.

??? note "Golems"
    - Golems walk forwards when activated, destroying traps, damaged walls, and sentries in their path until they reach a solid wall or door.
    - Golems are only available after defeating the Greater Warped One at least once.

### Saving the Duke

There are three routes to choose for the Gaurda Fortress Abyss:

1. Princess Pulgritte
2. Pontiff Leaufonde
3. Admiral Avare

You gain access to the Gaurda Fortress area once accepting the "Duke Ixion" request from the **Royal Capital Luknalia** Adventurer's Guild.

    ??? note "Sentry Types"
        - Combat Sentry: Necromancer and Skeletons

    ??? note "Combat Sentry"
        - Combat Sentries are dangerous enemy spawns that patrol around the map in short fixed routes.
        - Once spotted, you will be able to see their sight area highlighted in orange on the map.
        - Entering their sight area will cause the sentry to chase your party, however their movement is much slower than regular enemies.
        - These encounters can be challenging for the unprepared party, featuring new enemies such as the Cyclops, and more powerful versions of regular enemies with increased health and damage.

    ??? note "Corruption Sentry"
        - Entering the sight area of a Corruption Sentry will trigger a short cutscene and increase Corruption.
        - See [Corruption](#key-mechanics) for more information about Corruption Sentries.

    ??? note "Walkthrough 1st Run"
        1. Fight your way through B1F until you pass a Sentry to reach the **Minor Harken**. 
        2. Travel south from the Harken and descend the stairs to B2F.

    ??? note "Walkthrough 2nd Run and onwards"
        1. You can use the golem nearby to block the view of the Sentry.
        2. Continue as usual.

    ??? note "Sentry Types"
        - Combat Sentry: Necromancer and Skeletons

    ??? note "Walkthrough 1st Run"
        Navigate your way through the Pit Trap Puzzle to the final area of B3F.

        - This floor is full of hidden pit traps which will drop you into the floor below, B3F.
        - Fortunately this does not deal any damage to your party.
        - You will need to repeatedly trigger these traps to fall down to B3F and find stairs back to B2F.
        - In order to navigate to the exit, follow the paths marked on these maps:

            1. Red
            2. Orange
            3. Blue
            4. Green

        - The lever must be activated at the end of the Orange route to continue on the blue path.
        - The Harken is after the boss at the end of the Green route.

    ??? note "Walkthrough 2nd Run and onwards"
        1. This will be about the same, except the golems can be used to block the Corruption Sentry's line of view. The top golem is optional but the bottom golem is necessary to block the view of the sentry in the way.
        2. Continue as usual.

        - Race: Undead
        - Abilities: Instant-Death

        This undead horse is a more powerful version of the enemy found in Crucible Mausoleum, carrying a similar array of instant-death skills like "Spear of Doom".

    ??? note "Walkthrough 1st Run"
        - See Zone 2 Walkthrough 1st Run.

        - Combat Sentry: Scorpion Queen + (3 Chimeras or 2 Banshees)
        - Combat Sentry: 2x Minotaurs + 1 Chimera

    ??? note "Walkthrough 1st Run"
        - Upon returning from this floor to town, the slum faction request will become available.
        - It should be a straight shot to the end of this floor. There is no need to enter through any one-way doors past the first room of this floor. There will be a lot of sentry patrols around the end of the floor, so be cautious about maneuvering as you get closer to the end.

    ??? note "Walkthrough 2nd Run and onwards"
        1. There is only 1 golem that is needed to be pushed in this map, and it's the bottom one of the two at the bottom of the map.

        - Combat Sentry: 2x Minotaurs + 1 Chimera

    ??? note "Walkthrough 1st Run"
        - There are three paintings on this floor that give key knowledge. The painting at the very end will not be available to view until the second run onwards. 
        - Alarm traps are introduced on this floor. Generally, they just spawn 1 or 2 hostile enemies nearby, but they can be easily avoided. The very last alarm trap on the floor before the Cross Intersection will spawn a Corruption Sentry that is unavoidable without the Right Hand power of this abyss.
        
    ??? note "Walkthrough 2nd Run and onwards"
        1. The concept of crushing alarm traps is introduced in this map. You need to crush the alarm trap near the end to prevent it from spawning the Corruption Sentry.
        2. Remember to view the painting near the end of the map.

    ??? note "Enemies"

        - Combat Sentry: Scorpion Queen + (3 Chimeras or 2 Banshees)
        - Combat Sentry: 2x Minotaurs + 1 Chimera

    ??? note "Walkthrough 1st Run"
        - A somewhat difficult floor due to being a battle of attrition in saving resources to fight the floor boss. There is no need to enter any one-way doors and it's not necessary to step on any poison tiles on the first run through.

    ??? note "Walkthrough 2nd Run and onwards"
        1. The concept of crushing sentries is introduced on this map. You will need to do so to pass by the Corruption Sentry in the room with 6 Golems in two parallel lines.
        2. Near the end, you can skip the Doll boss entirely by crushing them with a Golem.

    ??? danger "Boss: Doll"
        - Abilities: Charm, Confuse, MP Drain

        The doll is the first real wall of the Guarda Fortress abyss and can be very challenging, as it's purely RNG-based. She attacks twice in each turn, hits hard with single and row target attacks, has a full party charm that drains MP, and casts a confusion that targets three party members at random. She has approximately 11k HP and high evasion, so she's fairly squishy...if you're able to hit her.

        !!! note "Tips"
            - If you've been keeping yourself low level to maximize experience gains, you might consider leveling up to at least 55
            - Buy some Scrolls of Sedation in town for your damage dealers to cast REILIS and remove confusion
            - Cast BATILGREF on the doll to lower her evasion and slow her down
            - Stack KINAPIC from scrolls and your priest(s) to give both rows enhanced resistance
            - Remove confusion and charm with your damage dealers via scrolls so your healers can focus on that.
            - One viable strategy is to un-equip weapons from any physical DPS and have your main DPS be the slowest so that any faster teammates can cleanse their charm.

??? map "Zone 8 -Fortress 1F Entrance-"
    ![](./img/zone-8-complete.jpg)

    ??? note "Sentry Types"
        - Combat Sentry: Cyclops + (2 Succubus + 1 Vampire or 1 Minotaur + 1 Succubus)
        - Combat Sentry: 2 Vampires + 2 Succubus
        - Combat Sentry: 1 Greater Demon + 1 Minotaur

    ??? note "Walkthrough 1st Run (1st Half from Zone 8 to 9)"
        1. From this point onwards, there are no rest points until the Zone 9 Harken is reached. However, it is not as simple as walking from Zone 8 to Zone 9. It will be a walk from Zone 8 to Zone 10 and then falling down to the Zone 9 Harken. There is no need to walk through one-way doors.
        2. Luckily, you won't need to explore a whole floor each time but rather just small portions of each floor. It is recommended however to carry a lot of consumables before continuing, as the Sentries on this floor are a lot stronger than previous floors.

    ??? note "Walkthrough 1st Run (2nd Half from Zone 9 to Zone 8 back to Zone 9)"
        - You will drop down and the nearby door is blocked by corruption. Ignore this for now and continue onwards. You're forced to pass by a Corruption Sentry in the bottom left of the map.

??? map "Zone 9 -Fortress 2F Entrance-"
    ![](./img/zone-9-complete.jpg)

    ??? note "Enemies"
        - Combat Sentry: Cyclops + (2 Succubus + 1 Vampire or 1 Minotaur + 1 Succubus)
        - Combat Sentry: 2 Vampires + 2 Succubus
        - Combat Sentry: 1 Greater Demon + 1 Minotaur'

    ??? note "Walkthrough 1st Run (1st Half from Zone 9 to Zone 10)"
        - There may be a room that will lock behind you on this floor. There is a rotating sentry and corruption sentry inside. You will need to get seen by the corruption sentry to access the door with the switch that opens the door out of this room. Otherwise it will be straightforward.

    ??? note "Walkthrough 1st Run (2nd Half from Zone 8 to Zone 10)
        - Similar to the 1st Half depending on map generation.

??? map "Zone 10 -Fortress 3F Lord's Room-"
    ![](./img/zone-10-complete.jpg)
    
    If your corruption level is not too high, you will find the Duke's party on this floor.

    ??? note "Enemies"
        - Combat Sentry: Cyclops + (2 Succubus + 1 Vampire or 1 Minotaur + 1 Succubus)
        - Combat Sentry: 2 Vampires + 2 Succubus
        - Combat Sentry: 1 Greater Demon + 1 Minotaur

    ??? note "Walkthrough 1st Run 1st Half (Upwards)"
        - It's a relatively chill walk to the top middle room. You are forced to trigger a corruption sentry while passing by. Upon reaching the top middle room, you'll need to drop down via a hole on the bottom left of the room. This drop you into the sight of the corruption sentry, but right outside of the Zone 9 Harken.

    ??? map "Path to boss"
        In order to reach the boss, you must circle around to the other side of the stone pillar and interact with it. Along the way, you will encounter one mandatory sentry battle and on your first run, you will encounter a second mandatory sentry battle during the dialog prompts.

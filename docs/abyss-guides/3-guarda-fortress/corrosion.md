# Corrosion Sentries Locations

## Overview

There are a total of 13 corrosion sentries you can encounter in Guarda Fortress. 

## Mechanics

??? note "Corrosion"
    - Corrosion is a central mechanic of this Abyss, with major changes depending on the level of corrosion.
    - Corrosion is increased when your party enters the sight area of a Corrosion Sentry.
    - Corrosion cannot be decreased whilst in the Abyss, but can be changed by modifying Causality in the **Cursed Wheel**.

    ??? note "Corrosion Effects"
        - **Fortress Appearance:** Slime becomes more prominent with high Corruption.
        - **Quest Availability:** Some quest-lines become unavailable as essential NPCs are driven insane or die as a result of high Corruption. This affects which endings are available.
        - **Monsters:** Different monsters spawn, with stronger monsters at lower Corruption. 
        - **Greater Warped One:** The Greater Warped One is much stronger at lower Corruption, gaining new abilities and increased damage and health.

??? note "Golems"
    - Golems walk forwards when activated, destroying traps, damaged walls, and sentries in their path until they reach a solid wall or door.
    - Golems are only available after defeating the Greater Warped One at least once.

### "Fortress 3rd Floor Arrival"

!!! warning "Warning"

    - To register corrosion sentries [10]-[13] you must do the entire route from the Zone 9 Harken ("Fortress 2F Minor Harken") to the Zone 10 Fountain ("Fortress 3rd Floor Arrival") without exiting or wheeling elsewhere. It is the other half of the Fortress floors (Zones 8-10), so plan accordingly
    - Corruption sentry [12] is particularly buggy 

!!! tip "Time-saving tip"

    - These are the most time-intensive corrosion sentries to register. It is possible to register the "Not spotted" flag for all 4 in one run with a little planning
    - The rooms with corrosion sentries [10] and [12] are not accessible on your first run and are tied to quests related to the endings
        - Corrosion sentry [10] = "Search for the Missing Girl" request 
        - Corrosion sentry [12] = "Blackmail Resolution." 
    - This means that you will have to do them both twice. It is in your best interest to head to the Zone 10 Fountain after being "Spotted" the first time you encounter them as part of their respective quests.
    - For corrosion sentries [11] and [13] you can be "Spotted" during your first run and you can include their "No spotted" run when registering [10] and/or [12]

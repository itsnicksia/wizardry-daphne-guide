# Corrosion Sentries Locations

## Overview

There are a total of 13 corrosion sentries you can encounter in Guarda Fortress. 

## Mechanics

??? note "Corruption"
    - Corruption is a central mechanic of this Abyss, with major changes depending on the level of Corruption.
    - Corruption is increased when your party enters the sight area of a Corruption Sentry.
    - Corruption cannot be decreased whilst in the Abyss, but can be changed by modifying Causality in the **Cursed Wheel**.

    ??? note "Corruption Effects"
        - **Fortress Appearance:** Slime becomes more prominent with high Corruption.
        - **Quest Availability:** Some quest-lines become unavailable as essential NPCs are driven insane or die as a result of high Corruption. This affects which endings are available.
        - **Monsters:** Different monsters spawn, with stronger monsters at lower Corruption. 
        - **Greater Warped One:** The Greater Warped One is much stronger at lower Corruption, gaining new abilities and increased damage and health.

??? note "Golems"
    - Golems walk forwards when activated, destroying traps, damaged walls, and sentries in their path until they reach a solid wall or door.
    - Golems are only available after defeating the Greater Warped One at least once.

??? map "[2] Enshadowed Well of Life - Zone 3"

    ??? warning "Routing Tips"
        - The Zone 2 Fountain is the registration node for this corrosion sentry. Both the "Secret Path Keeper Vanquished" corrosion sentries ([3] and [4]) are directly south of the Fountain. If you do not use a Hook of Harken to exit immediately, then you will encounter the South [3] sentry on your way to the exit 
        - It is possible to register all 3 corrosion sentries in one run, but requires defeating the Zone 3 Necrocore mini-boss. If you plan to do this, then make sure you are well-prepared with Expulsion weapons and gear, bondmates, and units (Red Beard, Galina) that have insta-kill tolerance

                - Route back to Zone 1 Harken: From the Zone 2 Fountain proceed south past the Southern [3] corrosion sentry. Go through the door. Ignore the sentry to your immediate right and keep heading south. At the bottom of the map there is a dead-end with a hole to drop down to Zone 3.

    ??? warning "Routing Tips"
        - The "[4] Secret Path Keeper Vanquished - Central Corrosion Sentry" is located directly north of this one, but requires low corrosion to access. Both of them can be registered at the same time to avoid a repeat visit 
        - You must defeat the Necrocore mini-boss in Zone 3 again to register this corrosion sentry. Be sure you are well-prepared with Expulsion weapons and gear, bondmates, and units (Red Beard, Galina) that have insta-kill tolerance

            - Push the southern golem to the left > "Not spotted" flag triggered
            - Proceed to the Necrocore mini-boss fight in Zone 3. The fastest route is to head left, kill the sentry in the hallway, go north to the large room with the patrolling sentry. Drop down the hole in the center of the room to Zone 3 and the Necrocore fight will be directly ahead. Exit via the Zone 3 Harken once done

??? map "[4] Secret Path Keeper Vanquished - Central Corrosion Sentry - Zone 2"

    ??? warning "Routing Tips"
        - This corrosion sentry requires a low level of corrosion to access. Turn all corrosion sentries in your CW to "Not spotted" before jumping 
        - The "[3] Secret Path Keeper Vanquished - Central Corrosion Sentry" is located directly south of this one. The encounter is unavoidable in order to exit without a Hook of Harken. Both of them can be registered at the same time to avoid a repeat visit 
        - You must defeat the Necrocore mini-boss in Zone 3 again to register this corrosion sentry. Be sure you are well-prepared with Expulsion weapons and gear, bondmates, and units (Red Beard, Galina) that have insta-kill tolerance

        - Push the northern golem up

    ??? note "Registration"

        === "Spotted"
            - This corrosion sentry must be done **twice**. During a first run it is inaccessible due to corrosion blocking the hallway
            - Optional: Some players have reported triggering the "Spotted" flag without defeating the the Necrocore mini-boss. If you'd like to test this, then jump to "Enshadowed Well of Life" (Zone 2 Fountain), get spotted, and then exit via a Hook of Harken or take the path back to the Zone 1 Harken
            - In town go to the Ruins > "Secret Path Keeper Vanquished" > exit via the Zone 3 Harken
            - Do a "Not spotted" run and see if the corrosion sentry is registered

The fastest route is to head south past the [3] South corruption sentry, go through the door, head left (on the map), kill the sentry in the hallway, go north to the large room with the patrolling sentry. Drop down the hole in the center of the room to Zone 3 and the Necrocore fight will be directly ahead. Exit via the Zone 3 Harken once done

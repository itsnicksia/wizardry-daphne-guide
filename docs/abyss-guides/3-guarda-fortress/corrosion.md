# Corrosion Sentries Locations

## Overview

There are a total of 13 corrosion sentries you can encounter in Guarda Fortress. 

## Mechanics

??? note "Corruption"
    - Corruption is a central mechanic of this Abyss, with major changes depending on the level of Corruption.
    - Corruption is increased when your party enters the sight area of a Corruption Sentry.
    - Corruption cannot be decreased whilst in the Abyss, but can be changed by modifying Causality in the **Cursed Wheel**.

    ??? note "Corruption Effects"
        - **Fortress Appearance:** Slime becomes more prominent with high Corruption.
        - **Quest Availability:** Some quest-lines become unavailable as essential NPCs are driven insane or die as a result of high Corruption. This affects which endings are available.
        - **Monsters:** Different monsters spawn, with stronger monsters at lower Corruption. 
        - **Greater Warped One:** The Greater Warped One is much stronger at lower Corruption, gaining new abilities and increased damage and health.

??? note "Golems"
    - Golems walk forwards when activated, destroying traps, damaged walls, and sentries in their path until they reach a solid wall or door.
    - Golems are only available after defeating the Greater Warped One at least once.

??? warning "Routing Tip"

    - Corrosion sentries [2], [3], and [4] can all be registered in the same run

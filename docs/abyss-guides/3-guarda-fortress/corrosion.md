# Corrosion Sentries Locations

## Overview

There are a total of 13 corrosion sentries you can encounter in Guarda Fortress. 

## Mechanics

??? note "Corrosion"
    - Corrosion is a central mechanic of this Abyss, with major changes depending on the level of corrosion.
    - Corrosion is increased when your party enters the sight area of a Corrosion Sentry.
    - Corrosion cannot be decreased whilst in the Abyss, but can be changed by modifying Causality in the **Cursed Wheel**.

    ??? note "Corrosion Effects"
        - **Fortress Appearance:** Slime becomes more prominent with high Corruption.
        - **Quest Availability:** Some quest-lines become unavailable as essential NPCs are driven insane or die as a result of high Corruption. This affects which endings are available.
        - **Monsters:** Different monsters spawn, with stronger monsters at lower Corruption. 
        - **Greater Warped One:** The Greater Warped One is much stronger at lower Corruption, gaining new abilities and increased damage and health.

??? note "Golems"
    - Golems walk forwards when activated, destroying traps, damaged walls, and sentries in their path until they reach a solid wall or door.
    - Golems are only available after defeating the Greater Warped One at least once.

            - There are several roaming sentrys in the area
            - Requires walking through poison tiles

            Directions:
            
            - From the Zone 6 Harken go up the stairs and proceed through Zone 7 until you reach the large room with 6 golems. 
            - Zone 7 can roll different map variations. The large room might be rotated, but the golem pushing order remains the same (see "Golem Directions - Corrosion Sentry")
            - Crush the corrosion sentry > "Not spotted" flag triggered 
            - To register proceed to the end of Zone 7 and defeat the Doll boss 
            
            !!! warning "Note"
                - Defeating the Doll boss again is _not_ mandatory. It can be crushed with a golem (see "Golem Directions - Doll") for a hidden achievement
                
            - Exit via the Zone 7 Harken

## Fortress (Zones 8-10)

??? note "[8] Fortress 2F Minor Harken"

!!! "Time-saving Tip" 
    - To register [8] and [9] you must do the entire route from the Zone 7 to the Zone 9 Harken without exiting or wheeling elsewhere. It is roughly 50% of the Fortress floors (Zones 8-10), so plan accordingly
    - Corrosion sentry [9] is encountered before [8] 
    - Both corrosion sentries can be registered at the same time to avoid multiple runs

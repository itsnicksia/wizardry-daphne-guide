# Trade Waterways Wandering NPC Guide

There are a number of characters that wander the Abyss who you may encounter.  They may be a help, a threat, or simply a distraction. These chance encounters often present you with a choice of interactions that may bring you additional riches or even personality changes.  

## Bone Picker  
"Might I interest you in some slightly used body parts?"

??? note "Details"  
    - Location: Most floors (Districts 1-7 and Ship levels 1 & 2)  
    - Interaction Options:  
        - The Bone Picker has several items he'll sell to the player:  
            - Healing Potion - 100gp - Always available  
            - Adventurer's Remains - 1,000gp - Once every 7 days  
            - (If unlocked) Mausoleum Bone Tallow - 10,000gp - Once every 7 days  
    - Personality Impact: None known.  
    - Notes: The cooldown timer on Remains and Tallow appear to be 7 days from the last time collected, not tied to the weekly game reset.  If you have insufficient gold, the interaction will be dismissed without affecting any cooldown timers.  

## Shady Merchant  
"These top-quality artifacts can be yours today for the bargain price of 5,000... no only 2,000 gp! Quantities limited, act now before they're gone!"

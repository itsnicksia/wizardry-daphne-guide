# The Trade Waterways

??? note "Some tips for this Abyss before starting"
    - To make the run easier, one can grind out Undead March Request from the Beginning Abyss to get to level 40 and complete the Grade Up exam.
    - A vast majority of the enemies in this Abyss are water element, so it helps to get as many earth-element weapons and armor (preferably to +10) from Earth Den BF1.
    - Iron/Steel level gear are commonplace drops in this Abyss, so it's recommended to begin building some in preparation for the next Abyss.
    - ==Do not sell any Sahuagin Scales== when obtaining them as you begin this Abyss, as they are needed for a mandatory main story request.

Note: There are areas where you are carried by a strong current. You must unlock the ability to reverse the water statues. Some have a timer to become cursed again. Some areas will be completely submerged. You should lure monsters out of the water in these areas or they\`ll be stronger

         - The mermaid statue on this and subsequent floors give important lore both contextually and are significant for being able to fight Octonarus. Make sure to get their knowledge.

    ??? note "About this floor"
        - Your first scripted battle is on this floor against a Lizard Commander, at the end of the floor.  This is a strong enemy with a lot of armor.  The best strategy is to block and create openings if your team is undergeared and/or underleveled.

    !!! note 
        When you’re locked in the room and drowning, you need to attempt to leave the area through both the upper left and upper right sections of the room you’re in, as well as attempt to go back into the current before you’re able to activate the statue to drain the water. Heal with items as needed and take as few steps as possible\!

??? map "5th District - Sunken City"
    ![](./img/trade-waterways-5.png)

    ??? note "About this floor"
        There are quite a lot of flooded rooms in this floor. You cannot cast magic while underwater, so it's recommended to carry scrolls on spell users. Aquatic enemies like Sahuagin gain significant action speed and evasion while underwater. If possible, try to lure fights out of the water.

??? map "6th District - Warehouse"

    ??? note "About this floor"
        There is another scripted battle on this floor against an Oar Collector. It is advised to turn off the northwest most dragon statue via the north path before fighting the Oar Collector as it will grant 3 turns of unsubmerged combat before the water levels rise again.

    ??? note "About this floor"
        There are a lot of enemy spawns on this floor, and no real way to avoid them as there are narrow corridors. This is also where you find the NPC with the key for all the locked doors in the previous floors.

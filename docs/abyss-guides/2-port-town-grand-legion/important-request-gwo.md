# Port Town Grand Legion - Important Request and Greater Warped One

## Mechanics

- Recommended Level: 30+
- Recommended Element: Earth

### Water Statues

These statues create rivers that control movement throughout the map, often forcing you into specific locations.

Bring a Hook of Harken to retreat if your party is too injured to proceed.

Later in the dungeon, on Trade Channel 4th Street, you’ll encounter an event that allows you to disable these statues.


### Locked Doors

Red-marked doors on the minimap are inaccessible until the end of the dungeon. 

Near the dungeon's conclusion, an NPC on a ship will give you a key to unlock these doors, just before the arena segment.

## Arena

!!! warning "Arena Warning"
    Most of the arena fights follow the same pattern of attempt it and die, Lulu asks you what happened then tells you to talk to Rickett (by the Ship's Hold harken), you get one or more requests, you complete them, then you try the fight again and win.

    In order to save on resurrection costs on your first time through the arena, it's a good idea to send the MC alone to Arena 1, Arena 3 (Princess and Admiral routes), Arena 4, and Arena 5. You can alternatively send the MC alone the first time on every fight, but if you die against Arena 2 or Arena 3 Pontiff route, Lulu will pretty much tell you that it's a skill issue and there's no reason you should have died.

??? "Arena Fights in a nutshell (if you really need it)"

    ### Arena Round 1

    1. You will die due to being stunlocked and instant killed. Only go in with the main character.
    2. Pay some gold or complete [Eradicate Warped Ones Request](./requests.md#eradicate-warped-ones-belowdecks) to remove the instant kill.
    3. Return to town and complete [Exterminate Farm Monsters Request](./requests.md#exterminate-farm-monsters) to give the Mimint to the head chef. Consume Mimint Potage to remove the stun lock.
    4. Beat up stinky boi.
   
    ### Arena Round 2

    1. This is a normal fight that depends on talking to Bonnie and Clyde in 7th District - Pier.  If you haven't talked to them yet, you will face a group of not-too-difficult Warped Ones. If you have, who you fight will depend on where you are in your progress with their story.  At this point you can move on, the additional steps below are optional.  
        a. Changing this fight involves wheeling back in time to where B&C appear at the Pier (Arena 1 or earlier) then progressing through several changes to their dialog. You will need to wheel back to and refight Arena 1 for the dialog change to register for the Abyss 2 fight.  
        b. The first time you talk to them, you will choose one to encourage. You will fight whichever of them you chose and then gain knowledge from them about why the other died. To complete their story you'll want to encourage each once.   
        c. After learning why they died, you will be able to, one at a time, take requests from them to [get Clyde a better sword](./requests.md#pirates-cutlass-delivery) and [get Bonnie some chain mail](./requests.md#steel-wire-delivery) so they (individually) survive. You will then again face each one again (slightly buffed) in the Arena.  
        d. After attempting to save each with equipment, you can again try to [equip both with Arena survival gear](./requests.md#battle-item-set-delivery), after which you will face them both. **Warning, after defeating them they attempt the Butch gunpowder technique to take you all out in a damaging explosion.**  
        e. Last, after learning they both die no matter what, you can try to [convince them to leave town](./requests.md#delivering-chamomile-for-the-dead). If you succeed, they both live and you again fight a group not-too-difficult Warped Ones.  
        f. The Bonnie and Clyde side-story is optional but later after returning to town you will learn of their fate and gain an Achievement and a Luck Lamp for the Well of the Mind.  
    2. After the fight, when asking about Round 3, the missing person you are looking for is blown up in a fight with Butch.  
    3. See below for additional steps (Saving the Missing Person and Not Being Murdered)  

    ### Arena Round 3

    1. You may die depending on who it is. Shagtis is a scripted death, whereas Vernant is extremely difficult but killable (not recommended at this point). Pickerel is relatively straightforward. Go in with the main character only if you're sure you're going to lose.
    2. If Vernant or Shagtis, talk to Pickerel and complete [Temple Food Assistance Request](./requests.md#temple-food-assistance) for Pickerel's help in the fight. If Pickerel, then just kill him and move on, unless you would like a relatively difficult boss fight (probably more difficult than the GWO of this abyss) which requires you to complete [Monster Bird Soup Request](./requests.md#monster-bird-soup).
    3. Win the fight and continue.

    ### Arena Round 4

    1. This fight is winnable, but like Vernant, extremely difficult to do so (Basically a big stat check fight). If you are not confident in your team or are already struggling a    bit in general, only go in with the main character.
    2. Head to Lower Deck 1, and head to the switch. Either fight the guard or give him a food voucher. Flip the switch to lower the water.
    3. There will be a new request at the Royal Capital, which is the [Purple Garlic Delivery Request](./requests.md#purple-garlic-delivery). Complete it and give the Garlic to the head chef and eat the garlic dish.
    4. Win the fight. You will get a bondmate if you did not do Step 2 and 3.

    ### Arena Round 5

    1. You will die, so go in with the main character only.
    2. Go to Rickert and complete [Murder Investigation Request](./requests.md#murder-investigation) to turn off the infinite magical beasts.
    3. Talk to the Under Cook in the food hall to obtain [Gathering Sahuagin Scales Request](./requests.md#gathering-sahuagin-scales) at the Royal Capital. Give the peppers to the Under Cook to turn off Geuzen's singing.
    4. Win the fight.

## Saving the Missing Person and Not Being Murdered

1. After winning your second arena battle and watching your missing person get blown up, use the wheel to go back in time to before fighting the second battle.
2. Find Butch and complete the [Obtaining KnightQuil](./requests.md#obtaining-knightquil) request
3. After completing the quest, beat up your second arena battle opponent again and re-watch the scene. Your missing person lives this time\!
4. Proceed ahead with the remaining arena battles. 
5. You won - time to claim your reward!

## Epilogue

After you beat Melgina, watch the scenes. 

Congratulations \- you lived, completed your request, and more importantly, received the lexicon that allows you to read the 7 mermaid statues you encountered\!

### Decision Point

From here, you have two options.

1. The first is to use the wheel to go back to the start and do a different faction request. This will effectively start you over in the Port Town Grand Legion and you will have to progress through the maps as if it was your first time, except you will have the lexicon, so you can read the mermaid statues as you come across them and pick up some very valuable information.
2. The second is to not start on a new faction request. Instead, within the same completed path, go around and read all the mermaid statues again, pick up some very valuable information.

The path you choose is ultimately yours, and the only difference is with option 1, you will have to fight Melgina again before you are really able to fight Octonarus. Note that if you are trying to get the IQ Guiding Light, you’ll need to fight Melgina (not Octonarus) a second time anyway, so I personally took the first option because it made sense to me to just collect the mermaid statue knowledge as I went through the maps again. If you do take option 1, this same decision point applies at the end where you can either repeat option 1 for the third faction or move on to option 2\.

## Octonarus

Once you’re ready to fight Octonarus, you first need to learn about him by reading the 7 mermaid statues throughout the map. This assumes you have that knowledge and know about his existence. Note that these steps are the identical steps needed to get [Melgina as a bondmate](../../adventurer-customization/bondmates/port-town-grand-legion/bondmates.md#melgina). If you do not take these steps and just call out Octonarus’ name instead of fighting Melgina during the 5th arena battle, you will end up in a battle with Octonarus where he will resurrect Melgina indefinitely. Not fun\!

1. Use the wheel to travel back to **One-Eyed Sahuagin** and speak to the Gessi destroying the statue using the “**Don’t you want to save Melgina**” option
2. Use the wheel to travel back to **Flooded Town** and speak with Melgina using the “**Do you want to be free from Octonarus**” option
3. Complete the [Rustproof Knife Delivery](./requests.md#rustproof-knife-delivery) request that Melgina gives you instead of getting her the mackerel sandwich
4. Complete the [Titanium Ore Delivery](./requests.md#titanium-ore-delivery) request to \`have the blacksmith make it and give it to Melgina
5. Use the wheel to travel back to **One-Eyed Sahuagin** and talk to Gessi again, using the “**Dont you want to save Melgina**” and “**I understand, Gessi**” options
6. Complete the [Obtaining Titanium Ore](./requests.md#obtaining-titanium-ore) request
    1. Note that if you want Gessi’s help against Octo, when you do the next step, make sure you configure the wheel so that you did not give the Purple Garlic to the head cook
7. Use the wheel to travel back to **Arena Round 5** and after defeating Geuzan, engage Melgina with the “**Melgina's liberation**” option
8. You now get to fight Octonarus
    1. As part of this fight, you will still have to fight Melgina first, and she will resurrect once (you will have to fight her twice), however she will refuse resurrection after that
    2. You cannot request healing prior to this fight, so make sure you conserve what you can while fighting Geuzan, and bring some potions to heal up as needed before engaging Melgina

## Greater Warped One

### Melgina

#### Battle Tips

* Weak to earth, so `ERLIK` from Yekaterina and Den of Earth weapons will be very helpful
* Buffing with `MASOLOTU` and `CORTU` can greatly reduce the damage you receive through evasion and spell damage reduction
* `KINAPIC` can be useful to help prevent any issues related to your party being put to sleep, however you can still get some bad RNG here
* Make sure you reapply any crucial buffs or debuffs if Melgina clears them
* Mages (Yekaterina in particular) should keep `Mental Unity` up so they can quickly clear any adds she spawns with a line spell.
* If running two mages with one being Yeka, a single `KATINO` from your second mage followed by a `Mental Unity`-buffed `MAERLIK` will clear the adds out, quickly preventing any long-range bombardments

#### Right Arm of Reversal Usage

* Use it on one the statue to drain the water.

### Octonarus

#### Battle Tips

* You will have to fight Melgina twice before Octonarus, so it's beneficial to try to burst her down as soon as you can. Unconfirmed, but she appears to have lower health in this fight than in the fight with her as the Greater Warped One. When you get to his phase, Octonarus can be fought a bit more defensively
* This fight in general is the same as the Melgina fight but with more "stuff" being thrown at you
* Weak to earth, so `ERLIK` from Yekaterina and Den of Earth weapons will be very helpful
* Buffing with `MASOLOTU` and `CORTU` can greatly reduce the damage you receive through evasion and spell damage reduction
* `KINAPIC` can be useful to help prevent any issues related to your party being put to sleep, however you can still get some bad RNG here

    ### Tips
    
    #### Watch for Stuns
    
    Since **Sweeping Tail Strike** can stun your healer, ensure you have potions ready to sustain the party if healing is delayed.

    #### Exploit Vulnerabilities
      - Equip **Air-elemental weapons** like the **Sword of Breeze** to maximize damage output.
      - If you have a Mage specializing in Air magic, use their abilities. If not, consider using **Jarmil** and his inherent Air spell, **FERU**, for single-target damage.
    
    #### Manage Debuffs
      - Be prepared for **Corrosive Liquid**, which lowers armor on your frontline, making physical attacks more dangerous.

#### Battle Tips

* Weak to air, so `FERU` from mages (can be inherited from `Jarmil`) and the Sword of the Breeze will be very helpful
* Give the `Digging Mattock` to a front-liner that is not the MC so they can help clear the debris piles he creates
* `MASOLOTU` and `MAKALTU` can increase your front line's evasion and Defense Power respectively, lowering the incoming damage
* `PORTO` can be used to increase one adventurer's action speed while `BATILGREF` can reduce his Evasion and Action Speed
* `BALAFEOS` and `DILTO` can reduce his Attack Power and Accuracy respectively, lowering the incoming damage
* `MORLIS` can decrease his Defense Power, increasing the non-spell damage your party deals
* Mages should keep `Mental Unity` up so they can quickly clear any adds he spawns with a line spell

#### Right Arm of Reversal Usage

* Use it on one (or more in subsequent turns) of the debris piles he creates to clear them so your front line can hit him again.

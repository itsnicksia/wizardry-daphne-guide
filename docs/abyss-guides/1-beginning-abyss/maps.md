# The Beginning Abyss

## Overview
The Beginning Abyss is an eight level dungeon that serves as both a game tutorial and an introduction to the overaching Wizardry Variants Daphne story.  Your primary goal is to [complete the request to Save the King](./important-request-gwo.md)!  It's not as easy as it sounds, and it may take you a few tries. The key is to keep progressing in the story despite setbacks and you'll eventually learn how to get the job done right.  Each floor has a very similar square layout with various events, [side quests](./requests.md), tricks, and traps. The one exception to this is a side dungeon on the third floor called the "Goblin Den". You will be warned away from this area if your level is too low.  *Savor the risk* but DON'T IGNORE WARNINGS FROM THE GAME! 

## Maps

!!! warning "Map Variations"  
    - Some floors have tile variations (shifts and rotations) randomly chosen when you start the abyss, and certain actions can reset the dungeon layout changing the variation you see. Two variations of the maps with tile changes are included below, but your maps and the location of certain events may not perfectly match these.  
    - Events and items on variable tiles always occur in the same rooms on those tiles even though they may have moved and rotated, so look for similar features. See [Map Variations page](../../mechanics/map-variations.md) for details.  
    
??? map "B1F -Pit-"

    !!! note
        Not much to say, first floor, welcome. Look for the Beginning Abyss Key for a nice surprise on floor 2. Make sure to talk to Chris and Mudd to eventually unlock bondmate quests. They're the two adventurers on the left and right side dead ends when you first enter.

??? map "B2F -Temple-"

    !!! note
        You will fight your real first boss here. Not much to say, use the harken afterwards. Only important thing of note is the room to the right has an infinite respawn mob that you can grind on early levels. If you found the key on B1F, the locked room on the left will have a few Adventurer's Remains to help you build your team (one time only).

??? map "B3F -Cave-In Zone-"

    !!! note
        Continue your way through the level until the story forces you examine the rocks around you. Examine all surrounding surfaces in all directions enough times and you can clear the rocks and proceed. Make sure you clear all rocks on the level to find important knowledge. There's a camp that restores all your hp/mp/sp and can eventually let you have conversations with trusted allies. It can be used once each time you enter the labyrinth. The Goblin's nest is not worth doing yet. Listen to Lulu, leave it for later.

??? map "B4F -Labyrinth"

    !!! note
        First time here? You get to watch your friends die. Second time here? Fix it! This is the first time the game shows you raising a stone will change certain map paths, that's really it. Keep moving the stones until a path opens up. Those two chests in the northwest? You can only pick one (the left has an adventurer's bone). Oh, watch out for the rabbits. They've got a vicious streak a mile wide.

??? map "B5F -Warped One's Nest-"

    !!! note
        The top left side in the beginning of the map is the 'warped one's nest', I don't suggest going there unless you're prepared. The larger rectangular area will have a boss for you. Prepare accordingly. Also, check this map to avoid the poison tile paths unless you want the Adventurer's Remains in the chest at the end of the path.  There are also two very good iron-grade weapons to be found in the three-chest rooms.

??? map "B6F -Map Killer-"

    !!! note
        These dead men tell tales.  The first corpse tell you which door will have spikes behind it.  The next two will tell you the correct warp order matching the sun (north then west, like the setting sun). Statue room puzzle requires you to restore the statue heads that match your party members according to the clue on the nearby dead body. If none match, leave all heads broken. This clue can change every time you enter this level. [See answers in the FAQ](../../frequently-asked-questions.md#how-do-i-solve-the-statue-puzzle-on-b6f-of-the-beginning-abyss). Saint shield quest is also completed here; do the second warp wrong and fight the mob.

??? map "B7F -Amongst the Dead-"
    
    !!! note
        You will need to go through the poison floors every time UNTIL you reverse the stones on B8F which will create shortcuts. B8F description tells you which stones open which paths. Make sure to do that. Albano will REALLY not like you here, unless YOU DO something correctly. The camp here is important as you can't access the Harken on the next floor until you beat the final boss.

??? map "B8F -Deepest Depths-"

    !!! note
        The four stones on this floor can be reversed to create new paths on B7F.  Starting from the entry stairs, the closest two stones creates paths on B7F at X:21,Y:11 and X:12,Y:2 letting you reach the unreachable treasure chests. The third stone connects the entry room to the hallway with the Camp by adding a path on B7F at X:8,Y:14.  The fourth stone connects the hallway with the Camp to the hallway with the stairs down to B8F by adding a path on B7F at X:14,Y:15.  No, you must kill the boss to reach the Harken. Yes, there are mimics now. They hurt, but good news, defending their attack gives you a big opening for massive damage. Good luck on the boss, and hope your head won't fly. (It will if this will be your first playthrough.)

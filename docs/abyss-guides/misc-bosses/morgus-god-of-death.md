# Morgus, God of Death

??? note "Requirements"
    - Clear Ominous Shadow Investigation.

## ^^Boss Characteristics^^
- He is Dark Element and No Race.
- He is immune to all debuffs and CC except for CT down (doesn't help much).
- He is immune to surety.
- All his physical attacks have a chance to instant kill.
- He has around 30k HP.

## ^^Boss Skillset^^
- Normal Attack = Relatively high damage normal attack, does very little to backline.
- Brain Death Nightmare = EXTREME Dark physical Nuke on whole team.
- Obsidian Grave = Summons two Undead Mages with ~1.5k HP each that do Prayer Offering (instant kill move with 1 turn charge)
- Scythe of Nightmares = Powerful Dark Row physical that has chance to fear
- Trial of Silence = Montino basically
- Omega Crest = Mazelos basically
- Sanctuary Blast = Lazelos basically
- Soul Perfection = Single target -20 Fortitude, -30 SP and MP
- Silent Deathbringer = EXTREME Dark physical single target damage 

## ^^General Fight Characteristics^^
- The fight always starts out as an ambush.
- He will always start with Brain Death Nightmare.
- He will cast Obsidian Grave out of turn at a certain HP level. Happens twice. Once at around 7k-8k HP and once at 25k-27k HP.
- He will cast Brain Death Nightmare out of turn as a certain HP Level. Happens once at around 15k-16k HP.
- He can move twice per turn relatively often, especially if your team's overall ASPD is low or drops due to teammates dying.

## ^^Suggested Setup^^
- As much light gear as possible. Farm Den of Light for every character.
- Run at least 2 Priests and 3 very high damage DPS (Fighters preferred).
- Stack as much Divine Power as possible on the priests. You will spend most of the time casting Madios.
- If possible, put as much Instant Kill Resistance on the MC + key units on your team. However, even with high Instant Kill Resistance, he still can proc it quite frequently.
- Try not to bring Light Units, as all his attacks are Dark element and do heavy damage.
- Make MC Dark element + give him a lot of Instant Kill Resistance + Get Deep Look Back and Reversal Resonance.

## ^^Strategy (Assuming Level 60 Cap)^^
- Pray you only have a maximum of 1-2 characters that die at the start.
- Keep track of damage, so you can slow down DPS at the ~15k HP mark for most of your team to defend. Knight's Defense works too if you can time it well.
- git gud at timing resurrect
- You will want to just focus entirely on DPSing Morgus down.
- Kill the mages summoned by Obsidian Grave in a timely manner.
- FPS FPS FPS

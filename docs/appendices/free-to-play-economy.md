# Free-to-Play Resources 
Certain resources in Wizardry Variants Daphne can be used to obtain in-game content or upgrade your adventuring party. While many can be purchased at the [Wizardry Variants Daphne Official Store](https://store.wizardry.info) at the Jeweler (see [Guide Purchase Evaluaions page](./purchase-evaluation.md)), Free-to-Play (F2P) players rely on in-game resource accumulation over time. The summary below tries to cover regular, reliable resource accumulation methods. Intermittent events can provide additional resource gain opportunities, some of which are noted where appropriate.  

## Gems
Two Gem types: Gems of Erin (Purple) and Gems of Org (Green).   
Purple Gems must be purchased through one of the methods mentioned above.  Green gems can be purchased as well, but can also be obtained in-game for free.  Both gem types generally exchange at the same rate for items, although there are certain Purple-gem-only Jeweler items.  Unless noted otherwise, details below refer only to Green Gems.

!!!note "Monthly totals assume a 30-day or 4 week month for easy math."

### Uses
Gems can be used in the game as a general currency for upgrades at the Jeweler (adventurer's remains, equipment packs, spellbooks, class change books, etc.) and in-game activities (resurrections, Mausoleum assistance, expanded inventory space, relic removal, etc.). Some in-game activities let you use gems instead of Gold for the same item. Gems are scarce enough that use for those cases is discouraged. Popular uses are listed here:

#### "Banner" Adventurer Remains:
- The most popular gem use is for Limited time special adventurer's remains that give a chance (typically 2%) to get new Legendary characters or new skins for existing characters.
- These special remains typically cost 200 gems each from the Jeweler, or 11 remains for 2,000 gems.
- Each Limited remains usually gives, along with the random character, one 'pity' token that can be exchanged at the Jeweler for remains, equipment, and supplies.
- Guaranteed banner character remains typically cost 100 (for legendary) or 60 (for non-legendary) tokens.
- At a 2% success rate, the probability at least one success in N pulls is: P(N) = 1 - 0.98^N.  so on the way to reaching pity is: P(60)=70%, P(100)=86.7%
- Thus, odds are fairly good you will get the banner character before hitting the 'pity' limit, but the gem-cost of a 100% guarantee banner pull is:
    - 60: 5 x 2,000 + 5 x 200 = 11,000 gems
    - 100: 9 x 2,000 + 1 x 200 = 18,200 gems
    - Banner events sometimes provide 2-4 free remains that slightly reduce the above "guarantee" amount by 200-600 gems.
    - The maximum regular gem rate of 2,800 gems/month gives enough for '100% pull' on legendary banners every 18,200 / 2,800 = 6.5 months.
    - Usually this is significantly reduced by irregular sources.  Monthly 'possible' gem rates above of 3,400-5,300 reduce this to 3.4-5.4 months.
    - Banner adventurers generally come out more often than this. <em>F2P players should not expect to get every banner with free resources</em>.
    
#### Handbooks
- Ally class changes <em>[require class-change handbooks or similar items for every class change event for that character](../adventurer-customization/class-changes.md)</em>.
- The Jeweler offers four random class change books each week at a cost of 400 gems each (two are limited to Purple Gems).

#### Inventory Storage Increase:
- The default inventory storage space is 500 slots.
- The limit can be increased by 25 items for 100 gems up to 1,000 slots for total of 2000 gems. 

#### Adventurer's Guild Adventurer Limit Increase:  
- The default registered adventurer headcount limit is 100.
- The limit can be increased by ___ for ___ gems up to ___ slots for a total of ___ gems.

## Guild Points
Guild points (blue tokens) are granted for completing activities at the Adventurer's Guild

!!!note "Blacksmithing ore and Amnesia incense are also available (for removing attached Bondmates), but both are now more easily obtained through in-game activity."

## Adventurer's Remains
### Uses:
In this game, Adventurer's Remains are used by the Masked Adventurer to resurrect allies to help him in his adventure.  Remains can be specific to one particular adventurer, or to a group or type of adventurer, or can be ordinary remains that pull from the general adventurer pool.  Gaining additional adventurers increases your party options and gaining duplicate copies of adventurers can increase the power of your adventuring party in numerous ways by [allowing skills to be inherited or increased in power](../mechanics/discipline-and-inheritance.md), or by providing adventurer tags for [grading up to higher levels](../abyss-guides/grade-exams/maps.md). As such accumulating adventurer remains is one of the primary ways, even a necessary way, of advancing in the game.

## Guild Tags
Guild Tags are required to increase a character's Guild Grade that sets the maximum level the adventurer can reach.  An [exam must be passed and a Guild Tag payment must be made](../abyss-guides/grade-exams/maps.md) to rise above level 20, and for every 10 levels thereafter.  In addition, the required Guild Tag [is formed by Unifying two tags of the previous level](../frequently-asked-questions.md#how-do-i-get-grade-tags).   

#### Tag Requirements per Adventurer per Grade
<div class="nofilter-table nosort-table" markdown>
| Adventurer Grade    | Max Level | Tag required | Ungraded Tag Count | Cumulative Ungraded Tags | Party of 6 Cumulative Tags|

</div>

As this table shows. the required number of tags for each grade grows quickly and tag accumulation can become a primary bottleneck for advancing in the games. A party of six adventurers requires a total of 90 ungraded guild tags to reach Steel Grade.

<div class="nofilter-table nosort-table" markdown>

| Legendary                         | 1 Iron Grade, 1 Ungraded (5 Ungraded equivalent) | 
</div>

At high grades, dismissing extra adventurers may be necessary or collecting enough Guild Tags to advance.  Using the numbers of regularly available adventurer remains as described above, the available tags are: 

<div class="nofilter-table nosort-table" markdown>
| Remains                                           | Tags from dismissing 35 Ungraded Remains |
|:--------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------|
| All Anonymous                                     | 35                                       |
| All General                                       | 70                                       | 
| All Legendary                                     | 35 ungraded, 36 iron                     | 
| *Expected Value<sup>†††</sup>* saving legendaries | *49 ungraded*                          |   
| *Expected Value<sup>†††</sup>* using legendaries  | *50.75 ungraded, 1.75 iron*                |   
</div>
<small><sup>†††</sup> using the standard adventurer remains drop rates: Anon:50%, General:45%, Legend:5%.</small>

From this we see about 70 ungraded tags can be obtained monthly using regular means (tags + all regular remains).  Including legendary dismissals, the iron tags make it equivalent to about 78 ungraded tags, noting that iron tags can not be 'downgraded' and are only useful to reach Steel and higher grades.

While it does involve a player deliberately sacrificing other party improvement options for tags, we can consider including the regular 2,800 Gems/month producing ~15 additional remains for a total of 50 available for dismissal:

Using these numbers, the time to grade up an adventuring party:

<div class="nofilter-table nosort-table" markdown>
| | Regular Tags alone | dismissing regular Anon/General Adventurers | and Legendary Adventurers | including Gem bought Anon/Gen Adventurers | and Legendary Adventurers |
|:-------------------------------------------------|:----------:|:---------:|:----------:|:---------:|:---------:|
| 6 member party ungraded-to-iron tag accum. time  | 2.1 months | 2.4 weeks | 2.4 weeks  | 1.9 weeks | 1.8 weeks |
| 6 member party iron-to-steel accum. time         | 2.4 months | 2.8 weeks | 2.5 weeks  | 2.1 weeks | 1.9 weeks |
| 6 member party ungraded-to-steel tag accum. time | 4.5 months | 5.2 weeks | 4.6 weeks  | 4.0 weeks | 3.5 weeks |
</div>

All told, the tag economy does place a throttle on free-to-play adventurer progress.  While a player with game knowledge could race through the first three abysses in a few days, without investment they will find themselves level-locked until accumulating enough Guild Tags for advancement.

# The Beginning Abyss

!!! note
    Certain floors have randomly generated tiles, so your map will not match 100% of the map I posted.

??? map "B1F -Pit-"

    !!! note
        Not much to say, first floor, welcome. On second playthrough, make sure to talk to Chris to unlock a bondmate quest. He's the elf on the left side deadend when you first enter.

??? map "B2F -Temple-"

    !!! note
        You will fight your real first boss here. Not much to say, use the harken afterwards. Only important thing of note is the room to the right has an infinite respawn mob that you can grind on early levels.

??? map "B3F -Cave-In Zone-"

    !!! note
        You can continue your way through until the story makes you examine the rocks. Examine it enough times and you can reverse time and proceed. Make sure you reverse time and find the cause of death of your friends. There's a camp where it restores all your hp/mp/sp. It will be restored every time you exit and enter the labyrinth. The Goblin's nest is not worth doing, leave it.

??? map "B4F -Labyrinth"

    !!! note
        First time here? You get to watch your friends die. Second time here? Read the true ending guide\! This is the first time the game shows you raising a stone will lower and raise certain paths, that's really it.

??? map "B5F -Warped One's Nest-"

    !!! note
        The top left side will be a warped one's nest in the beginning of the map, I don't suggest going there unless you're prepared, not much there. The larger rectangular area will have a boss for you. Prepare accordingly. Also, check this map to avoid the poison tile paths.

??? map "B6F -Map Killer-"

    !!! note
        The beginning fork may vary. Don't bother opening the wrong door where the corpse tells you. It's just spikes. The corpses will give you hints to get through the level. I believe the correct warp order is right, up, then right or left depending on the previous corpse warning. (The light/sun rises in the east and sets in the west.) Statue room puzzle requires you to restore the statue heads that match your party members according to the clue on the nearby dead body. This clue can change every time you enter this level. [See answers in the FAQ](../frequently-asked-questions.md#how-do-i-solve-the-statue-puzzle-on-b6f-of-the-beginning-abyss). Saint shield quest is also completed here; do the second warp wrong and fight the mob.

??? map "B7F -Amongst the Dead-"
    
    !!! note
        You will need to go through the poison floors every time UNLESS you reverse the stones on the next floor that create shortcuts. Make sure to do that. B8F description tells you which stones open which paths.  Albano will REALLY not like you here, unless YOU DO something correctly (second playthrough only). The camp here is important as you can't access the Harken on the next floor until you beat the final boss.

??? map "B8F -Deepest Depths-"

    !!! note
        The four stones on this floor can be reversed to create new paths on B7F.  From the entry stairs, the closest two stones creates paths on B7F at X:21,Y:11 and X:12,Y:2 to reach the unreachable treasure chests. The third stone connects the entry room to the hallway with the Camp by adding a path on B7F at X:8,Y:14.  The fourth stone connects the hallway with the Camp to the hallway with the stairs down to floor 8 by adding a path on B7F at X:14,Y:15.  No, you must kill the boss to reach the harken. Yes, there are mimics now. They hurt, but good news, defending their p atk gives you a big opening for massive damage. Good luck on the boss, and hope your head won't fly. (It will if this will be your first playthrough.)

### Viscount Guane
After returning from the Flooded Town you will be approached by a representative of the faction you have chosen. If you already cleared each route, or want to redo the ending to the Viscounty Guane mission then you will have to curse wheel to before Flooded Town and then curse wheel to Flooded Town and immediately return to town. If you want to change faction you have to curse wheel to Search Request.

Aegon -> Princess Route

Egolion -> Pope Route

Goetia -> Admiral Route

![](img/viscount_post_flooded_town.png)

1. Go to the Royal Capital's Adventurers Guild to attend the mission.

    You can either:
    
    a. Pay up (3000 gold)
    
    b. Force Your Way Through (Easy Fight)

    c. Turn back (You Leave the Quest Area)

    - However you get additional options when turning back. If you have a mage in your party you can select "Let's just bulldoze our way through" 
    
    This will cause the mage in your party to cause a distraction so you can bypass the encounter without paying and there is no mana cost. If you don't have a mage, you just enter the same route as "Force your way through"

        - Find Pickerel at the marked location

- Speak with the head chef and he’ll tell you where to pick up the ingredients to make the soup

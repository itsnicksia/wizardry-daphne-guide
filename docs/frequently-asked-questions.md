| How do I get more Adventurers?                                                | You can get new Adventurers by reversing Adventurer and Legendary Bones, acquired from chests, daily rewards, Jeweler purchases, missions and the Mausoleum.                                     |
| How do I get the Featured Adventurer?                                         | You can get a Featured Adventurer by reversing their bones, purchased from the Jeweler. You will need 100 Reversals for enough tokens to exchange directly for the Featured Adventurer.          |
| How many Gems to guarantee the Featured Legendary Adventurer?                 | 18,200 Gems if you're buying 11 Featured Bones for 2000 Gems each time. This will give you 100 Tokens to purchase the Featured Adventurer from the Exchange.                                     |
| Which Bones should I buy?                                                     | Featured Legendary Bones. Buying `Adventurer's Remains` is not recommended.                                                                                                                      |
| When should I use `Adventurer Bones` and `Legendary Bones`?                   | Up to you. You can use them to strengthen your party with new adventurers, Discipline, and Skill Inheritance, or save for when new Adventurers are added to the pool.                            |
| What should I get with Guild Points?                                          | Gems and Adventurer's Bones.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Do Tokens carry over to other banners?                                        | No.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| What is the difference between Gems of Org (Green) and Gems of Erin (Purple)? | Purple Gems can only be obtained with real money, and are used to purchase Purple Legendary Bones and daily Skill Books. Green Gems can be obtained from daily rewards, purchases, and missions. |
| Why does the Featured Legendary Adventurer have two banners?                  | One banner uses Purple Legendary Bones which awards additional Featured Equipment when pulling the Featured Adventurer.                                                                          |
| Is Featured Equipment worth it?                                               | Not really. The random quality and grade make it risky. There are rare exceptions, such as the 3-hit Cuisinart Sword.                                                                            |
| What should I spend my Gems on?                                               | Legendary Adventurer Bones and Class Change scrolls.                                                                                                                                             |
| Which purchases have the best value?                                          | Experience and Class Remains packages have the most Gems per dollar. See [Purchase Evaluation page](./appendices/purchase-evaluation.md) for more information.                                   |
| Is there a Pity System?                                                       | No.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Is there a Spark System?                                                      | Yes. Each pull on a Featured Adventurer Banner gives a token which can be used exchanged for the Featured Adventurer (100 Tokens), Featured Equipment, Skill Books, and other items.             |
| Will Featured Adventurers be added to the Permanent Banner?                   | Drecom has announced that they will, but none have been added as of March 2025.                                                                                                                  |

| I got two copies of an adventurer and they have different stats. Is that normal? | Characters do have variations in base stats, their bonus points (up to 10) and their Fortitude (80, 90, 100). If you intend on doing a lot of summons, don't feel like you have to invest in the first version you get. That being said, the variations in stats, bonus points, and Fortitude are all extremely minor. |

## Other

### How do I access detailed in-game information about races, stats, classes, types, etc?
Go to the game Settings (gear icon) and click on `Help`. The Help section has a ton of information for you to absorb!

### Are there different tiers of adventurers that we can get?
Yes! This can be seen if you look at the Drop Rates for Adventurer’s Remains. The different tiers are: 

* **Anonymous Adventurer** (example: Human-Fig)
* **General Adventurer** (example: Marianne)
* **Legendary Adventurer** (example: Lanavaille)

Interestingly, there doesn’t seem to be anything on an adventurer’s stats page that indicates what tier they are in.

### Is there permadeath in this game?
There is, however it is very difficult to trigger. First, you need to have an adventurer with lower than 50 Fortitude. Second, you need to fail in resurrecting that adventurer at the Temple, causing them to turn to ash. Third, you need to fail at resurrecting the adventurer from ash. At that point, they are gone for good. Fortitude continues to regenerate while a character is dead, so when in doubt, just wait for adventurer’s Fortitude to be above 50 before you try resurrecting from the Temple.

### How often does Fortitude regenerate?
An adventurer restores 1 Fortitude every 6 minutes.

### If an adventurer is dead, does it still regain Fortitude?
Yes!

### I changed my adventurer's class with a scroll? Can I change it again?
You can, but you need another scroll to do so. Each scroll is a one-time use consumable.

### Why does my map look different than the ones in the guide?
For each floor, there are generally a few main rooms but the pathways to get between the main rooms can differ from player to player. While it’s possible to have a map that looks identical to someone else, it’s also possible to have your map be slightly different. This means not every spawn point for a particular request you encounter matches the spawn point someone else encounters. From what we can tell, every floor has a defined number of possible layouts that get loaded in for a player. We’re not sure how many possible layouts there are, though, so take any image you see of a map with a grain of salt, as yours could have differences.

### Wait, it’s possible to get an adventurer as a bondmate?
Yes! Although this isn’t something we recommend doing as the bonuses are very minor. In order to do this, you need to reach max trust with your adventurer then dismiss them. Yep, that’s right. You say goodbye to them. This is only recommended to use for duplicates if you don’t have any other use for them, or if you’re a completionist and absolutely must have that bondmate.

### How do I know which teleporters to take on B6F of the Beginning Abyss?
Look around for the corpses near each teleporter room. They’ll give you a clue about which teleporter to take. Think about the position of the sun in the sky to help guide you. The first body flat out tells you to ignore one room. The second body mentions something about the light ahead. Think North. The third body mentions following the dying light. Think about a setting sun.

### How do I solve the statue puzzle on B6F of the Beginning Abyss
This depends on the clue you get, which can change everytime you enter the level. Each statue corresponds to a member of your party when facing the teleporter. In general, you want to only repair the statue at the position that corresponds with the member or members that fits the clue. The answer could be that no statue gets restored.  The elf in the Tavern will tell you about Races and Classes using the same language used in the clues.

* "Ubiquitous race" = Humans (including main character)
* "Wise and long-lives race" = Elves
* "Brave Fighters" = Fighter (not Wanderer)
* "Skillfull" = Thief
* "Weakest" = Lowest Strength
* "Wise" = Highest I.Q.

If you get the answer right the teleporter will take you to a room with the exit stairs.  From there you will have to proceed down to B7F.

### Do I have to walk past the poison on B7F of the Beginning Abyss every time?
No! There are 4 stone piles that you can reverse on B8F. Two of these create shortcuts to bypass the poison. Two create pathways to treasure.

### How do I increase an adventurer’s level past XX?
At specific levels (20, 30, and 40), you need to grade up to increase the level cap.

Grading up requires two items:

* One grade tag for each adventurer taking the grade exam (note that this does not count adventurers in the party that have already graded up).
* A grade marker that is obtained by taking the appropriate grade exam The specific grade tag required depends on the exam you’re taking.

The current exams are Lead, Bronze, and Iron. All exams require a tag of your current grade (so the Lead exam requires each member to have a No-Grade Tag, and the Iron exam requires each member to have a Bronze Grade Tag). Grade tags are not consumed on taking the exam - instead, they are consumed when grading up after you have successfully passed the exam and obtained the required grade marker.

The TL;DR is that to grade up, each adventurer needs a grade tag of their current grade, and they need to have been a part of the exam where you obtained the next grade marker.

### How do I get grade tags?
Dismiss adventurers and combine lower grade tags into higher grade tags. In addition, you get a few from the weekly request. When dismissed, all adventurers will give you a grade tag that corresponds to their current grade. General and Legendary adventurers will give an additional grade tag as well.

* Anonymous Adventurers (Human-Pri, etc) give 1 grade tag that corresponds to their current grade.
* General Adventurers (Chloe, Clarissa, Flut, etc) give 1 grade tag that corresponds to their current grade, plus an additional 1 no-grade tag when dismissed.
* Legendary Adventurers (Lanavaille, Adam, etc) give 1 grade tag that corresponds to their current grade, plus an additional 1 iron grade tag when dismissed.

Due to the fact that it costs grade tags to increase an adventurer's grade, the increased value of tags you get is offset by the cost to grade up.

**There is no benefit in grading up an adventurer before dismissing them**. The weekly requests starts with a 3 tag reward and increases to 4 tags at a certain point. This isn’t confirmed, but it seems to be when your MC is level 40 in any class, possibly also requiring the MC having changed to another class.

### How do I swap lower grade tags for a higher grade?

### Help! I’m drowning! What do I do?
You need to attempt to leave the area through both the upper left and upper right sections of the room you’re in, as well as attempt to go back into the current before you’re able to activate the statue to drain the water. Heal with items as needed and take as few steps as possible!

## Character Questions

### What is Merging and should I do it?
For a detailed guide on the Merging mechanic please visit the [dedicated](https://wizardry.fasterthoughts.io/mechanics/merging/) page.

### What are character duplicates used for?
They can be used to:

1. Increase a character's Discipline level
2. Increase a character's unique skill level 
3. Inherit a character's inheritable unique skill to another character (or your MC) 
4. Dismiss for Grade Tags While dismissing a Legendary character seems scary, it's possible that for some characters, that will be the absolute best value of their duplicates due to the fact that dismissing a level 1 Legendary character that has not completed a grade-up exam will give you 1 No Grade Tag and 1 Iron Grade Tag. Grade tags could easily be a bottleneck as we get to higher levels.

### Should I pull on X character?
This will always come down to personal preference, and whales, dolphins, and F2P players will all have different thoughts. Nobody can tell you how you should spend your money or your pulls. The Character Analysis tab will have some thoughts on different characters that you can use to hopefully make informed decisions that you are happy with.

### Is there a limit to the number of skills I can inherit on a character?
No! At least not that we’re aware of at this time!

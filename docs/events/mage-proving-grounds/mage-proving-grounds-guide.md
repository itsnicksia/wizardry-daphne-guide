# Mage Proving Grounds

!!! item "This event is permanently available!"

## Guide:

There is no introduction to this event. Simply start the event by heading to the Royal Capital and accepting Beginner Mage Trial in the Featured tab. This will mark the location on your map.

You can obtain up to 600 Seals of the Mage by completing the trials up the Advanced. Specifically, 100 for Beginner, 150 for Intermediate, and 350 for Advanced. There are no missions for this event in particular.

There are several map variations, and are random upon entering. It is not necessary to explore the whole map, you simply need to make it to the end and defeat the floor boss. Keep in mind, it only counts as a clear upon talking to the masked mage at the end of the stage.

Keep in mind unique adventurer classes that are "mages" can enter such as Iarumas and Berkanan.

??? note "Tips"
    - Remember to carry potions on all three characters.
    - Carry a healing staff switch so you can use healing spells from the MC and/or other characters who have access to dios/madios. 
    - Normal enemies typically have less than 550 HP in all stages of the map. You can usually blow them up with one or two LA- spells. The hobgoblin tends to have quite a bit more hp, but nothing crazy.
    - All the enemies are very resistant to physical damage (they only take 1 damage).

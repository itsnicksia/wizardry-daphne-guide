## Part 1 (Berkanan Route)

The best ending for Part 1 requires three complete runs. Each run is relatively fast if you are strong. Note that you cannot progress to Part 2 of the event without fully completing Part 1.   

### Guides 

??? note "1st Run"

    === "Guide"
        1. Watch the cutscene in the Event tab (yellow shield in town menu).
        2. Head to the Adventurer's Guild in the Royal Capital and accept the request to save the missing people.
        3. Head to the event location, Sahuagin's Cave, via the Edge of Town in the Royal Capital.
        4. Find 3 people on B1F to save. Their locations are shown on the map.
        5. Find 2 people on B2F to save. They are dead already.
        6. Find an extra burned body on the way to the next floor. It's Iarumas.
        7. Go to the large, southern section of B3F. The Fire Dragon will show up and start throwing fire everywhere (you may lag quite a bit at this part).
        8. Move to the non-red tiles on the minimap ASAP or get killed instantly (do this 3 times).
        9. Return to the Royal Capital, watch the cutscene, accept the Fire Dragon request at the Adventurer's Guild, head to the Tavern, and talk to Iarumas.
        10. Return to B3F, try to fight the dragon again, but you are unable to (this part is important).
        11. Instead, now head to the sahuagin NPC on the minimap and kill them for the Sahuagin's Key.
        12. You can now open previously locked doors. Take the previously locked path on B3F to reach the side of the dragon.
        13. Select the option to have Iarumas serve as a distraction and complete the boss fight (see tab). However, it rages at the end and melts in the magma.
        14. Turn in the request and get basically nothing. Use the Event button, select Cursed Wheel, and rewind time to reset everything.

    === "Red Dragon Boss Fight"

        - The boss fight scales with the MC's adventurer grade. At Steel Grade, the dragon has about 15k HP. On the other hand, Lead Grade is maybe around 5.5k HP. Bronze Grade is around 7.5k HP.
        - It's highly recommended for players Bronze Grade or lower to farm the Dragon Slayer weapon and upgrading it to +10 or so before attempting, as it's extremely strong for that level range.
        - The dragon is susceptible to Paralyze, not Stun. This is most likely to encourage people to use Iarumas's unique skill that paralyzes. Other sources are also more effective than usual but not guaranteed (Mimic Secretion, Thunder Strike, etc).
        - The dragon can be spellbound, but it does not stop its roar or breath. However, it will be more inclined to use basic attacks that can be exploited for openings.
        - Evasion helps mitigate a lot of physical moves the dragon does, but requires a large amount (possibly 200+ for Steel Grade).
        - Water elemental weapons and spells help deal more damage to the dragon. Water armor helps resist the fire breath.
        - Cortu can mitigate some damage from the breath and magic, as Iarumas suggests, but as the dragon can sometimes go twice in a turn with mixed damage, it may not be enough alone.
        - If your team has enough damage, consider using Knight's Defense to mitigate damage if your team's gear is not specced to deal with the dragon specifically
        - It's suggested to have two priests as the dragon can hit the entire team all at once, so having heals for both rows helps a lot.
        - You need a minimum of 43 ASPD to outspeed the dragon at Steel Grade.

??? note "2nd Run"

    === "Guide" 
    
        1. Watch the cutscene of Lulu asking for information about the first run. Select all the options.
        2. For the 2nd run to trigger properly you need to immediately go through the previously locked door on B1F using the Sahuagin's Key. If you save anyone before going through the door, then you will end up on the first run.
        3. Save the 3 people on BF1 again. 
        3. Save the 2 people on BF2 again, however this run they will be alive since you got there early via the shortcut.
        4. Find Berkanan at the entrance to B3F, grab her body, and head down. If Berkanan's body is not appearing, then you missed saving one of the 5 people. 
        5. Same Fire Dragon event again, just dodge the fire.
        6. Head back to town to resurrect Berkanan. She is quite tall. If Berkanan does not get revived, then it means you exited prematurely and need to return and do the Fire Dragon event first on B3F.
        7. Head to the Adventurers Guild, turn in the request, accept the dragon request, go to the Tavern, and talk to Berkana and Iarumas.
        8. Head to the Blacksmith and accept the request to collect the ore to make a Dragon Slayer sword.
        8. Head to the 3 ore locations on the map (see tabs), which appear as shiny white stars.
        9. Return to the Blacksmith and he will make the Dragon Slayer. Now go back to the 3F side tunnel to fight the Red Dragon. 
        10. The Red Dragon is successfully killed this time, but Berkanan is still burned to death.
        11. Return to town, turn in the request, and use the Event button to rewind time to find a way to save Berkanan from dying.

??? note "3nd Run"

    === "Guide" 
        1. Repeat everything listed in the 2nd run up to the Blacksmith. This time you will ask for a shield as well.
        2. Head to the 3 locations on the map to pick up the ore, along with the one extra location for the shield.
        3. Return to blacksmith for the sword and shield to give to Berkanan.
        4. Defeat the Dragon again and successfully kill without Berkanan dying.
        5. Bid farewell to Berkanan and Iarumas as you can't seem to follow them into the strange dungeon.
        6. Return to town to turn in the request. Listen to Lulu yap about lore.

## Part 2 (Ainikki Route)
!!! warning "You will need to have cleared the Good ending (3rd Run) in order to unlock this part"
!!! warning "Since the event has rerun, Silver tier versions of the Unique Event Rewards that can be bought from the shop and dropped from special junk. The gear can generate as high as Purple 4*. In addition, you may purchase 99 copies of each, so it's recommended to focus on these instead of the previous versions. Keep in mind the shop versions always generate as Blue 3*, so if you want a higher grade/quality, you will need to obtain it from junk."

??? note "1st Run"
    1. Head to B1F, take the shortcut door, and save the civilians as normal.
    2. Upon reaching the stairs to B2F, the screen will glitch and provide 2 door choices. Select the Right Door (Ainikki Door) and enter through.
    3. B2F will be a completely different map, and various portions of the walls will have the glitched textures. Halfway through the floor, you will encounter a Knight that needs help, and interacting with them will engage a fight the Fire Dragon from Part 1. Simply defeat it as normal. Remember to rescue the singular civilian on this floor.
    4. Head to the stairs to B3F, and find Ainikki's body. Defeat the Sahuagins and pick up her body. Continue to B3F.
    5. Head to the Dragon location, but this time find a Black Dragon instead of a Fire Dragon. It will fog up the entire room, causing you to retreat. Head back to the Royal Capital and resurrect Ainikki. She will be assisting at the temple after being resurrected.
    6. Turn in the original request and pick up the dragon slaying request. Head to the Tavern in the Adventurer's Guild to talk to Iarumas and ask for his help in killing the Black Dragon.
    7. Head back to B3F and find your way back to the Black Dragon's Chamber. You will need to navigate nearly blindly unless you have a Ranger to cast Milwa, but it should be somewhat clear to go through the darkness especially if you turn the game's brightness up + possibly your device's screen brightness.
    
        ??? item "If you are having trouble with navigating through the fog, below are the exact steps to take when walking through it"
            1. Start on tile (X:13, Y:17) facing the inner chamber.
            2. Walk forward one, then turn right
            3. Walk forward two, then turn left
            4. Walk forward three, then turn left
            5. Walk forward four, then turn right
            6. Walk forward three, then turn right
            7. Walk forward two, then turn left
            8. Walk forward until dragon
    
    8. The next fight will be a FORCED LOSS. The Black Dragon is unkillable and can instantly kill your entire party with its breath (deals extremely high damage). It is recommended to come with only the MC if possible.
    9. You will have to cursed wheel and get Ainikki's help

??? note "2nd Run"
    1. Repeat the selection at B1F and save all civilians on B1F and B2F. On the second time around, you can choose to help or abandon the knight. Helping the knight will get you ambushed by the dragon, while abandoning will skip the fight entirely. Rescue Ainikki and resurrect her body at the temple.
    2. Turn in the request and accept the dragon slaying request again. Head to the Tavern and ask Iarumas for help. Leave the Adventurer's guild and ask Ainikki for help. This time, Iarumas will ask her to help as well.
    3. Ainikki agrees, but requires equipment to defeat the dragon. Head to the Blacksmith in the Royal Capital to help her craft a Morningstar. You will need several ore on B2F and B3F. Consult the maps listed for locations.
    4. Head back to Blacksmith after obtaining the Ore and craft the Morningstar. Head back to defeat the Black Dragon in B3F. Ainikki will cast Milwa for you when she is in your party to clear the dark fog. After the fight is won, Ainikki will slice the head off of the dragon. Iarumas and Ainikki head into the Other World, but you are still unable to follow them. You bid each other farewell.
    5. Head back to the Adventurer's Guild to turn in the request.

    - The fight is similar to the Fire Dragon, but it has slightly more HP (20k) at Silver Grade.
    - It is dark element as its color suggests, and is weak to light. Obviously, its breath is dark type damage.
    - The dark breath that it uses applies weaken on targets hits.

### Post-game Black Dragon Superboss Variation:

After completing the 2nd Run, you can head back to the chamber in B3F where the Black Dragon used to reside. The screen will glitch upon entering, indicating something has changed. Head to the very back of the chamber, and a path to the side will open into the Other World. Head inside and you'll be placed in an old-school pixelated dungeon where you can pick up two chests and also fight the true version of the Black Draogn.

??? danger "Black Dragon Superboss Fight Details"
    ![](img/black-dragon-superboss.png)

    - Has around 105k-120k HP. Has three actions per turn. Does not have very high Surety Evasion.
    - Has the typical moveset of the Black Dragon such as Roar (stuns), Black Flame Breath (weakens), Claw, Tail Swipe, Morlis, etc.
    - The dragon itself is dark element, and all of its melee attacks are dark element as well. As a result, it's highly recommended to equip various pieces of light armor if possible, along with using Augmented Dragonslayer if suitable.
    - The Bite attack of the Black Dragon can potentially do 4 digit damage.
    - The dragon tends to alternate between using Roar + Breath in one set of 3 actions, and melee attacks + casting magic in another set of 3 actions.
    - The Black Dragon's Balafeos is extremely potent, as it'll drop your physical damage to around 10% of its original damage.
    - The dragon is immune or highly resistant to Chronostasis, but can be Delay Attacked (not always) or Batilgref'd (consistent). It is recommended to try and slow the Dragon down with Batilgref and Scroll of Cascading Slowing.
    - The dragon can be debuffed, but it isn't consistent. It is also possible to apply status effects on this dragon, but it isn't consistent.
    - It is extremely recommended for the player to run a Knight with Knight's Defense, as it will be difficult surviving three turns of damage that easily hits 200-300 damage per action as well as being weakened from the Black Flame Breath.
    - Defeating this dragon may drop a unique Ebonsteel tier 2H Mace called the Black Dragon Warhammer. It has -25 Surety, but has Defense Penetration. This can also drop from the weaker version. In addition, the boss may drop a rare consumable that when used reduces enemy's damage dealt. It's also entirely possible this boss drops nothing.
    - The dragon may also additionally drop a Otherworld Dragon Blood, which is a one-time use consumable that lowers a target's damage dealt by ~10% for 4 turns. This item is somewhat of a rare drop.
    - To reset this boss, you will need to cursed wheel the event entirely.

## Farming The Event

There are three major ways to farm the event, each with their own pros and cons. Use your own judgement to determine which gives you the highest currency over time ratio.

* Map Reentry
    * Farming the event in this manner simply involves entering the map, moving to all the chests you see, then harkening out. This has the least amount of dialogue and loading screens but also the least amount of chests.
* Event Cursed Wheel
    * This has you using the event cursed wheel to reset the map. This resets both static chests on the first two floors as well as the stationary enemy encounters that have a high likelihood of dropping chests. This option has the most amount of dialogue and loading screens but also gives the highest number of chests.
* Main Cursed Wheel
    * This route involves you taking the cursed wheel back to either `The King's Rescue` or `Return to the Capital` and reentering the event dungeon. This is a bit of a middle ground between the above two options, as it respawns the static chests but not the stationary enemy encounters. It has fewer loading screens than the Event Cursed Wheel route, but more than the Map Reentry.

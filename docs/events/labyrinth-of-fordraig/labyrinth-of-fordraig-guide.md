## Overview

??? "How to Accept and Reset the Request" 

    - Request is located at the Royal Capital Luknalia in the Adventurer's Guild > Requests > Featured > "Stolen Armor Retrieval".
    - Once accepted go to the World Map and you will see a new location called the Labyrinth of Fordaig located north-northwest of the Royal Capital.
    - To reset, go to the Ruins and select the Cursed Wheel. In the bottom right-hand corner is a pink button called "Special Request." Click on "The Lost Treasure of Fordaig" to reset.

??? note "Endings" 
    - The event only requires 2 runs for full completion. 
        - The First Run ("trigger the traps") leads to the Bad ending.
        - The Second Run ("disarm the traps") leads to the True ending.
    - The Guide provides directions for both runs on a per map (floor) basis.

??? note "Important Notes"

    - The enemy level scales with MC's Grade.
    - There are a large number of Magical Beast enemies, so Abenius, Benjamin, and Yrsa are good to field along with anti-magical beast weapons or Well of the Mind (WoM) nodes for MC.
    - Total of 4 floors with Harkens on B1-3F, so you can clear each floor and return to the Inn before tackling the next one. Note that B4F is a large floor and you will want to conserve your resources for the boss fight.

!!! warning "Page has been updated. Ctrl + F5 to refresh."

## Unlock Conditions

- Full clear of Abyss 2 on any faction route
- Request is located at Royal Capital Luknalia in the Adventurer's Guild > Requests > Featured
- Once accepted go to the World Map and you will see a new location called the Labyrinth of Fordaig located north-northwest of the Royal Capital

## Overview

There are two endings: 

- The First Run ("triggers the traps") leads to the Bad ending
- The Second Run ("disarm the traps") leads to the True ending
- The Guide provides directions for both runs on a per map (floor) basis

Other notes: 

- The enemy level scales with MC's Grade
- Large number of Magical Beast enemies, so Abenius, Benjamin, and Yrsa are good to field along with anti-magical beast weapons or Well of the Mind (WoM) nodes for MC
- Total of 4 floors with Harkens on B1-3F, so you can clear each floor and return to the Inn before tackling the next one

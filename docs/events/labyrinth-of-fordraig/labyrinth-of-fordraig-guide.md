# Labyrinth Of Fordraig Guide

!!! warning "Page has been updated. Ctrl + F5 to refresh."

## Unlock Conditions
You need to have progressed in the story until completing the Second Abyss for the first time, and then accepting the quest that appears in the Royal Capital's Adventurers Guild. After accepting the quest, a new location will be available on the World Map.

## Overview

There are two endings to this event:
- The First Run ("trigger the traps"), which leads to the Bad ending 
- The Second Run ("disarm the Traps"), which leads to the True ending
- The Guide provides directions for each floor on a per map basis

Other:
- The enemy level scales with MC's Grade
- Large number of Magical Beast enemies, so Abenius, Benjamin, and Yrsa are good to field along with anti-magical beast weapons or Well of the Mind (WoM) nodes for MC
- Total of 4 floors with Harkens on B1-3F, so you can clear each floor and return to the Inn before tackling the next one

2. Head to the red "X" for the boss fight; he drops the Horned Eagle Sword that is always fixed at 3* blue and 2/3 strength-level (unification).
3. The yellow highlights are where three chests are located, one of which has the event item needed to complete the request.
4. The portal below MC's location (yellow arrow) leads to the upper-right area of B2F, which is self-contained. There are two fixed chests in this area.
5. There is no Harken on this floor and have to go back to the Blue X Portal to Exit.

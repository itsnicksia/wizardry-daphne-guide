### Overview

    - The request cannot be discarded after accepting. 

??? note "Important Notes"

    === "Objectives"

        - The goal is to revisit the Labyrinth of Fordaig and collect the bodies of 12 adventurers scattered across all 4 floors.
        - When collecting the bodies you will be forced into a fight against Undead enemies. The battles become increasingly more challenging as you progress. The final set of fights on B4F includes Necromancers that are roughly on par with their sentry versions in Abyss 3.  
        - The request is very straightforward. Use the maps for each floor and path to the yellow check-marks. You can exit and return at any point. It will not reset your progress. 

    === "Preparation" 
    
        - Undead Bane (Abyss 1) or Expulsion (Abyss 3) weapons otherwise you will do ~50% less physical damage.
        - Yekaterina's unique passive (standard style) does increased damage to undead enemies.
        - The number of mobs per fight increases per floor, so bringing multiple Mages with MA- or LA- spells is helpful.
        - Undead Slayer nodes for the MC in the Well of the Mind.

    === "Enemies"

        - When collecting the bodies the enemies are a mix of all Undead enemies (Archer, Mage, Knight, etc.) you have seen throughout the game. The normal Fordaig enemies remain unchanged.  
        - Big Skeletons are added to fights on the upper floors. Necromancers (Humanoid) only appear on B4F. 
        - Enemy levels are fixed per floor and do not scale with the MC's Grade. 

    === "Enemy Levels" 
    
        - B1F - Level 30
        - B2F - Level 40 
        - B3F - Level 49
        - B4F - Level 61 

??? "Rewards"
    
    - The base reward is 4 No Name tags and 5,000 gold for collecting 1 body.
    - You receive 4 No Name tags and 5,000 gold per additional body collected. 
    - A grand total of 48 No Name tags and 60,000 Gold for collecting all 12 bodies. 

### Maps 

??? note "Important Notes" 

    - The yellow check-marks are the locations of each body. Note that 2 of the bodies are accessed via the purple teleporters located on B1F (by the Harken) and B4F (SE corner), which will take you to the small sides areas on B2F.
    - There is no way to check the number of bodies you have collected. They are not shown in your Valuables or Requests List. Fortunately, you will get Lulu text after collecting all 12 bodies, so do not submit the request until that message appears.

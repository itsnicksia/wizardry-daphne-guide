### Guide 

??? "Search Process" 

    - After accepting the request, go to the indicated Abyss and begin searching the correct floor (see Ore Locations).  Lulunarde will inform you of the presence of the thieves when you arrive on the correct floor. 
    - On that floor there will be a fixed number of locations that can randomly spawn an non-mobile enemy, which will be a group of thieves. After killing the thieves you will receive a small amount of Gold Ore.  
    - Each time you exit the Abyss the location of the thieves will change. However, there are only a small number of fixed locations where they will respawn.      
    - If you paid the Old Man in the Guild Tavern, then the buried Gold Ore location will be marked on your map. Once you reach the location it will appear as a glowing, white object indicator (a "shiny") on the floor. It provides an amount of Gold Ore several times larger than the group of thieves.  
    - After collecting any amount of Gold Ore: 
        - Lulunarde will let you know it is up to you if want to search for more
        - A "Request Complete" message will pop up
        - At any point after this you can turn in your Gold Ore at the Guild. The size of the additional reward is based on the total collected. 
    - However, you do NOT want to submit the request prematurely as you will be missing out on a substantial amount of Gold (Abyss 1, $400K; Abyss 2, $600K; Abyss 3, $1M) that is given for collecting all of the Gold Ore. 
    - After collecting the maximum amount of Gold Ore you will receive Lulu text letting you know that you are finished. The thieves will stop appearing at the spawn locations. Return to the Royal Capital Guild and submit the request and receive the maximum additional god reward.

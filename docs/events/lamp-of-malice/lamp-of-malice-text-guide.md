## How to enable

The event will be enabled when one has reached Level B7 of the Beginning Abyss on the second run through.

## Walkthrough

Note: Like the main story more than one run will be needed to get the complete ending for this event.

On the entrance to the cave there is an altar from which to select the difficulty mode: Trial of Simplicity, Moderation, and Impossible. Each difficulty increases the monster levels and rewards. The default difficulty without interacting with the altar is *Moderation.*  

Maps (one check: crystal or peculiarity; three checks: elites):

After reaching the locked doors on B4F and interacting with the 4 altars, you’ll receive 4 quests to gather materials. Bat Wings and Frog Tongues can be obtained in B2F. Rat Teeth and Lizard Tails can be obtained on B3F.

After gathering all materials, interact again with the altars on B4F. You’ll be able to progress to the fight with Isabella, the Seal. 

After defeating Isabella, progress to B5F to get some lore, then return by using harken after fighting newly spawned undead on the way. A cinematic will ensue and you’ll be prompted to return with the event's own cursed wheel.

Now you start the second run through the event. There’ll be two new dialogue options on the guide in the beginning of the cave and now you can interact with the crystals, which require a new pickaxe (not the same from the main story).

Speak with the blacksmith. You can choose to either do a quest to acquire ore from the goblin cave or pay 3000G for the hammer. The quest is very hard, so you’re advised to pay for the hammer.

Gather Crystals: you need 4 Purification Crystals, but some of the crystals you mine will only cause cave-ins and unlock new areas. After interacting with the 4 altars again, you’ll be prompted to gather 4 Entity Shards from the Earth Elementals. 

!!! note 
    Rather than farming those, it’s easier to go to the east-mid of the B2F map (7:38 Video Guide) and fight the elemental there, win and grab the entity shard, leave the dungeon, reenter the dungeon, fight and repeat.

Interact with the 4 altars on B4F. Now, when the doors unlock, you can talk with Isabella and face the true boss.

         This farming route in B3F is an EXP / Currency farming route with 4-6 guaranteed combats adjacent to harken for ~fastest combats or chests per minute farming rate.

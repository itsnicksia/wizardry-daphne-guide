!!! item "This event is permanently available."

## How to enable:

## Guide

1. Go to Royal Capital, obtain the request "Recovery of Oni Treasure" in the featured tab. You will be given a pass key item. Head to the Port Town Grand Legion from the World Map and talk to the sailor in town with the chat bubble. He will bring you to the Island of the Wailing Oni. You may leave immediately if you wish, as the location is now unlocked on the world map.
2. Enter B1F and interact with the Samurai. Help him, as he is necessary for progression. Give him a Medicinal Herb (You can give from storage) or Dried Abalone. It doesn't really matter which one you do, as long as he has something to eat. 
3. Head to B3F, pick up the paper from a dead samurai. Ask Kanosuke to to help translate it. This is now a key item for later. Head to fight the Oni in the bottom left room. After he takes a certain amount of damage, he will be finished off by Kanosuke. However, Kanosuke will turn into an Oni. Pick up the key where the Oni used to be and use the key on every locked room in the dungeon. You might also need to interact with the shrine at the end of one of the rooms (middle room in B1F). Lulunarde will tell you when it's time to cursed wheel and your request will tell you the request is not completable and that you will need to cursed wheel.
4. Cursed Wheel the event and head to the island again. Save Kanosuke from hunger and hand him the letter that you got previously and he will now follow you so you can read the foreign language.
5. Head to the Archive Room (top left locked room) on B1F. It will be locked but there will be a clue to the key. The clue will be on B2F at (X:1, Y:17). Kanosuke will then mark the location of the key on your map with an exclamation mark (X:18, Y:13). Head back to the Archive Room and read all the texts on the shelves. You will need to stop the oni transformation via the shrine.
6. Head to the shrine via the middle locked room in B1F. You will need paper seals from the Archive Room (top left locked room in B1F) and salt from the Pantry (bottom left room in B2F). Head back to the shrine and let Kanosuke fix the shrine.
7. Head to the Oni and fight it again. Upon winning, head to the middle locked room in B3F and read the diary. Head back to the oni room and go into the treasure room to receive Kanosuke as a bondmate (Bind Tolerance), the gold statue for the request, and a recommendation from Kanosuke for his Samurai Dojo.

# Old Castle Ruins

## Notes about maps
1. The maps don't seem to reset.
2. Every 5th floor is a gauntlet map which contains 5 battles. Two normal enemy encounters and then every miniboss that you encounter before the portal of the previous floors. 
3. Every 6th floor is a checkpoint this means Harken. No enemies on this floor. 
4. There might be better routes, or you might have slightly different map. Just pay attention to the pattern of the layout around the portal if your map isn't similar. 

## Floor 1 ("Checkpoint")
The light just before the portal tells you the gimmick of the next couple of floors.

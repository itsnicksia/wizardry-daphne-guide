# Old Castle Ruins - Season 2

## Overview
The Old Castle Ruins event is a seasonal competition open to all players of a certain level. Once unlocked the town is always available on the World Map, but you can only enter the Ruins when an event is ongoing. The Ruins is a multi-floor castle broken into groups of floors, each group having a common set of enemies and a boss. Each floor group ends in a boss level where you re-fight all previous bosses in that group. The MC dying causes you to be sent back outside, no in-dungeon reversal. Reaching higher floors earns rewards and currency for a Ruins shop. There are best score leaderboards where rank can earn additional rewards at the end of the season.

All floors are static. Efficiency is measured by how fast you complete the floor

Boss Rush floors always have the same order of bosses.

Optimal paths for Foray Speed are listed below.

## How to participate:
The main character needs to reach Bronze Grade. After advancing to Bronze Grade, visiting the Adventurers Guild will trigger a dialog for the quest after which a new location will be available on the World Map.

## Tips

- It is ideal for Foray Speed to walk through poison and not cleanse it if possible. However, the penalty for doing so is very small.
- It is ideal to avoid mob battles, but not if it increases the number of steps needed on an optimal route. Fleeing to phase through mob battles is not recommended.
- It is ideal to finish battles as quickly as possible, as more actions taken per fight increases foray score.
- You are not penalized for taking time to think either in or out of combat. Only actions and steps are really taken into account for scoring.
- Flutterdream Flash increases your Foray Speed, so it is recommended not to use characters with this skill if possible on easier floors. The penalty is minimal however.

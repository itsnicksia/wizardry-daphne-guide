# Old Castle Ruins - Season 3

!!! bug "It is season 3 and there are still bugs with Foray Speed. Thank you Drecom"

All floors are static. Efficiency is measured by how fast you complete the floor.

Boss Rush floors always have the same order of bosses.

Optimal paths for Foray Speed are listed below.

## How to participate:
The main character needs to reach Bronze Grade. After advancing to Bronze Grade, visiting the Adventurers Guild will trigger a dialog for the quest after which a new location will be available on the World Map.  Note that once you've activated the event, the location will remain on your World Map even when the season ends. You will simply be denied entry to the ruins between seasons.

## PvP Floors:
Every safe floor (6, 11, 16, 21), has a PvP room where you can fight against other adventurer parties. There isn't anything for doing so, but they can be easily defeated with a strong mage with high ASPD.

## Foray Speed Calculation
- Each tile stepped on adds 5 to Foray Speed
- Each action done by an ally OR enemy in combat adds 2 to Foray Speed.
- Completing a fight REDUCES Foray Speed by 20
- Running from combat adds 32 to Foray Speed
- Using a statue adds 40 to Foray Speed
- Actions such as using a spell or item outside of combat adds 2 to Foray Speed
- Counterattacking = 0 Foray Speed
- Opening Chest = 0 Foray Speed

## Tips

- It is ideal for Foray Speed to walk through poison and not cleanse it if possible. However, the penalty for doing so is very small.
- It is ideal to finish battles as quickly as possible, as more actions taken per fight increases foray score.
- You are not penalized for taking time to think either in or out of combat. Only actions and steps are really taken into account for scoring.

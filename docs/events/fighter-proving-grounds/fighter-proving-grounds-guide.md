# Fighter Proving Grounds

!!! item "This event is now permanently available!"

## Guide:

There is no introduction to this event. Simply start the event by heading to the Royal Capital and accepting Beginner Fighter Trial in the Featured tab. This will mark the location on your map.

You can obtain up to 600 Seals of the Fighter by completing the trials up the Advanced. There are no missions for this event in particular.

There are several map variations, and are random upon entering. It is not necessary to explore the whole map, you simply need to make it to the end and defeat the floor boss. Keep in mind, it only counts as a clear upon talking to the old man with the mask beside the portal. There is a fountain that is guarded by a Benjamin-NPC on each side.

??? note "Tips"
    - Remember to carry potions on all three characters.
    - Carry a healing staff switch so you can use healing spells from the MC and/or other characters who have access to dios/madios. Consider using Self-Healing as well with a divine staff.
    - The enemies on the advanced floor consist of Minotaurs, Lesser Demons, and Chimeras.

??? danger "Intermediate Difficulty Fight Tips"
    - The final enemy is always a Minotaur. It has around ~7.5k HP. It has no element, and is affected by Magical Beast Slayer,
    - The Minotaur has a set order of actions. It will do nothing on Turn 1, 2 turn Defense buff on Turn 2, 10 turn Accuracy buff on Turn 3, 10 turn Attack buff on Turn 4, then begin attacking on turn 5 onwards with a CT down skill and Row-switching skill.
    - Katino and Kantios are effective but not guaranteed on the Minotaur.
    
??? danger "Advanced Difficulty Fight Tips"
    - The final enemy is always a Vampire. He has around ~7k HP. Vampires are dark element, and is affected by Vampire Slayer.
    - He will generally just basic attack that can be consistently dodged with 150~ evasion. Alternatively he may cast Zelos
    - He is susceptible to openings, which will inflict around 1k damage
    - He will cast Kaltu on himself at around half HP (~3.5k HP). When he is at low HP (~1k HP) he will do a 1 time Vampire Bats skill that inflicts very high damage. He will heal for about 10x of what the vampire bats hit on you.
    - It's recommended to try to chip him down to a point where you can finish him off in one turn with Full Power Strike from all 3 fighters.

    ??? note "Efficient Strategy for Vampire Slaying"
        Assuming you have three fighters that are able to deal 1k+ damage per hit with FPS, you can easily kill the vampire in 6 turns using the following strategy. Buy some Scrolls of Shared Power from the shop if you want to try this.

        - Turn 1: Use MORLIS, Armor Break, and Scroll of Shared Power
        - Turn 2: Use FPSx3
        - Turn 3: Smack the Vampire for 3k+ damage. He'll use KALTU.
        - Turn 4: Use MORLIS, Armor Break, and Scroll of Shared Power. Note that if the Vampire is faster than one or two of your party members, use BATILGREF instead of MORLIS this turn
        - Turn 5: FPSx3
        - Turn 6: Smack the Vampire for 3k+ damage. Around the first or second hit, he'll yell at you in Japanese. As long as your party all acts before he does next (thus the conditional BATILGREF), you'll kill him before he can bat you.

??? note "Master Fighter Ring"

    - The Fighter ring is always 4* Red and has fixed stats. Full Alter Stones can reroll the values but not the actual stat lines.

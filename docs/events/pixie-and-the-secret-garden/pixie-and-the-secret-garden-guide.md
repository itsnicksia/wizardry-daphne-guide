# Pixie and the Secret Garden

!!! item "This event is now permanently available!"

## How to participate:

You need to reach a certain point in the Third Abyss, Impregnable Fortress and view the Prologue story of the quest.

## Guide:
!!! note "There is no difficulty mode for this Event Dungeon. The mobs will scale automatically to your level."

There are multiple endings for this event, but overall the event is very quick to complete. It does require at least two Cursed Wheel resets to complete entirely though, 5 if you want all endings.

??? note "1st Run"
    1. Go to Event tab and watch cutscene.
    2. Head to royal capital tavern and watch cutscene, then accept the request. You will need to fight a single Pixie
    3. Head to the cave. You may skip all the marked spots except the flower patch at the middle right, as you need the flowers for the second run.
    4. Activate harken and go down right stairs (left stairs is a dead end with chests).
    5. Walk along the path and you will be forced to take a small amount of spike trap damage
    6. There will be a scripted fight with some goblins.
    8. Walking over the dead body will force you to return as Theo is disgusted by how Pan acts. Dialogue option here doesn't seem to matter here. You cannot press onwards as Lulu tells you not to, and the adventurers are blocking the way. 
    9. Returning to tavern has Theo faint from poison. You will head to the temple to gain the knowledge that the flower is poisonous and that the seeds can cure the poison.
    10. Grab request at tavern from the father and head back to cave B2F to the adventurers again to gain knowledge of getting them to move out of the way.
    11. Flower patch on B1f has no seeds and the way forward in B2F is blocked, so you must Cursed Wheel.

??? note "2nd Run"
    1. Go to tavern again, and give flowers to the addicts this time so they stay.
    2. Take request but this time lulu says to wait a bit for her, basically donabelles are invading the capital.
    3. Pick up the request again, and head back to the cave. Theo will not stay despite the new dialogue.
    4. As you pass by points of interest, you can choose not to investigate and simply tell Theo. This is just flavor text and has no importance.
    6. On B2F, you may step in front of Theo to avoid spike trap damage.
    7. Theo once again freaks out at the bodies and you must repeat the same as before, however this time you continue onwards in B2F.
    8. Every flower patch has no seeds and there is a jute bag in the top right room. This is just flavor text and has no importance.
    9. Head to the middle rightmost open room to find Pan dead, but obtain a few seeds to cure Theo with. The Killers have left already.
    10. Hand the seeds to Theo's father, but Theo is only partially cured, and the request is failed.
    11. Cursed Wheel again.

??? note "3rd Run"
    1. Repeat every step as the previous runs until Theo is poisoned again. Make sure you are carrying a Medicinal Herb.
    2. Head to the middle rightmost open room in B2F and immediately attack the merchants.
    3. You will be fighting about 5 masked thieves, with the main one having somewhat high evasion.
    4. Upon finishing the fight, receive a bag of seeds and a key for the door on B1F.
    5. Talk to Pan afterwards and hand them the Medicinal Herb. They will thank you and tell you to thank Theo.
    6. Return to Royal Capital and give the seeds to the father, and Theo will be cured and talk to you afterwards.
    7. You will gain both Theo and Pan as a bondmate (Ending 4), who are a earth element bondmate with Poison Tolerance and a air element bondmate with Magic Power respectively.

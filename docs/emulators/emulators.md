# Playing on PC

## Steam

This one is self explanatory.

### Steam Install to another Gaming Drive

If you have C:\ space issues, or want to keep big installs off of your nice SSD, here's how to symb link.

Navigate to:

C:\Users\
%username%\AppData\LocalLow\drecom

Cut the drecom folder and paste it on another drive, I moved it to F:\Games\Wizardry

The full path looks like this:

 F:\Games\Wizardry\drecom

Launch cmd, navigate to

C:\Users%username\AppData\LocalLow

Using the cd (change directory) command type:

cd AppData\LocalLow

If you aren't by default in your user section, you can

cd..  cd.. 

cd C:\users%username%\AppData\LocalLow

Type this command (please ensure the drive and path are what YOU setup, not me lol)

mklink /j drecom F:\Games\Wizardry\drecom

You'll get an error saying it exists if you haven't moved (cut/paste) the folder to the new location

If it succeeds, you'll see a shortcut-looking folder link in AppData\LocalLow for drecom

This is the symbolic link. Any data sent there actually ends up in your alternate location specified in the command line

## FAQ
### Which one is better?
For Bluestacks you can download through the Google PlayStore directly which is conveniet for both updates and if you want to buy packs and gain Google Play Points. However, you might run into crashes more frequently on Bluestacks. There will be more ads on Bluestacks. Some of the ads you can turn off, but others you can't. 

For LDPlayer, there aren't as many ads as Bluestacks. The ads won't be as intrusive than on Bluestacks. It can run better on lower end devices. Not as many crashes. However, you will not be able to download Wizardry Variants Daphne on the Google PlayStore. This means you can't buy packs and whenever there are updates you will have to wait until the apk is updated online or through a third party app like APKPure.

At the end of the day it is up to you and your personal preferences.

### I keep crashing on Bluestacks. How can I fix this?
If you are crashing when you try to open up the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy then you need to Uninstall the Google Chrome Updates on Bluestacks. 

Go to Settings->Apps->Chrome-> Clicking triple dot on the top right to uninstall updates. 

Refer to the Bluestacks installation guide for visuals. 

If you are crashing to homescreen whenever you try to open up Wizardry then you need to clear the cache. 

Go to Settings->Apps->Wiz Daphne->Storage & Cache->**CLEAR CACHE** and **NOT CLEAR STORAGE**

Refer to the Bluestack Crashing Bug Guide for visuals.

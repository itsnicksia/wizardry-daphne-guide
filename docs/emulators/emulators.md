## FAQ
### Which one is better?
For Bluestacks you can download through the Google PlayStore directly which is conveniet for both updates and if you want to buy packs and gain Google Play Points. However, you might run into crashes more frequently on Bluestacks. There will be more ads on Bluestacks. Some of the ads you can turn off, but others you can't. 

For LDPlayer, there aren't as many ads as Bluestacks. The ads won't be as intrusive than on Bluestacks. It can run better on lower end devices. Not as many crashes. However, you will not be able to download Wizardry Variants Daphne on the Google PlayStore. This means you can't buy packs and whenever there are updates you will have to wait until the apk is updated online or through a third party app like APKPure.

At the end of the day it is up to you and your personal preferences.

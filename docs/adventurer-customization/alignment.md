# Alignment

All adventurers have an Alignment, including your own character.

There are three Alignments: 

 - Good
 - Neutral
 - Evil

This affects gameplay in several ways:

 - Eligibility for Formation Skills
   - For example, Rinne grants Surety to adjacent Evil allies.
 - Adventurers gain trust faster when their Alignment is closer to yours.

Adventurers other than yourself have fixed Alignment; there is no known way to change their alignment.

## Changing Your Alignment

Your character's alignment is initially defined by your answers to the questions given at the start of the game, but can change over the course of the game depending on your choices and actions.

### Towards Good

Acts of generosity will shift your alignment towards **Good**:

- Administering healing items

### Towards Evil

Dishonourable, selfish, or unethical acts will shift your alignment towards **Evil**:

- Sacrificing adventurers
- Ambushing enemies

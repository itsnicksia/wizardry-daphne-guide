# Alignment

All adventurers have an Alignment, including your own character.

There are three Alignments: 

 - Good
 - Neutral
 - Evil

This affects gameplay in several ways:

 - Eligibility for Formation Skills
   - For example, Rinne grants Surety to adjacent Evil allies.
 - Adventurers gain trust faster when their Alignment is closer to yours.

Adventurers other than yourself have fixed Alignment; there is no known way to change their alignment.

## Changing Your Alignment

Your character's alignment is initially defined by your answers to the questions given at the start of the game, but can change over the course of the game depending on your choices and actions.

Afterwards, there are two main ways to change alignment:

1. Action choices made towards enemies before combat.
2. Choices made during Story Progression.

### Towards Good

Acts of generosity will shift your alignment towards **Good**:

- When prompted before combat, select "Administer Healing Item"

### Towards Evil

Dishonourable, selfish, or unethical acts will shift your alignment towards **Evil**:

- Sacrificing an adventurer in a certain request for unlocking the Ninja class (See Plot of the Sand Shadow).
- When prompted before combat, select "Ambush".

## How Long does it take to change Alignment?

Alignment appears to exist on a continuum you can treat as being like a gauge or a point value.  In terms of Ambushes/Healing-items, you can treat each alignment block as about "15 points wide". If starting at 0 being the evilest that could ever be eviled, Neutral would be at around 15-16 "actions", and Good would start at another 15-16 "actions", with being the goodest of goodies at ~45 "actions". This is the understanding of alignment as of now.

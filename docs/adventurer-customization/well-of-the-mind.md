!!! warning
    Skill, spell, proficiency, and class nodes are always in the same location. Every time you reset the Well, however, stat and type change nodes reset.
    Sometimes they seem to change location, but other times they actually don't show up at all.
    For example, it is possible to have 3 Surety nodes on one reset and just 1 Surety node on another reset.

??? warning "Missing Guiding Lights"
    If you met the requirements to obtain a guiding light but don't have it actually available in the Well for use, try exiting and restarting the game. Some of them seem to need a reboot to show up properly.

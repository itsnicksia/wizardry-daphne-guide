# Well of the Mind and Guiding Lights

## Well of the Mind

The Well of the Mind is a unique main character customization element accessible from the Ruins where you can unlock classes, skills, spells, and stat increases using "Mind Pearls".  

You start with 4 Mind Pearls. More are obtained by using ["Guiding Lights" that can be collected through progressing in the main story](#guiding-lights). Guiding lights are used by unlocking a color-matching clouded area of the Well after activating a node adjacent to that clouded area. This will open those nodes for use and give you an additional 1-4 Mind Pearls. Presently, the maximum number of mind pearls obtainable by activating all Guiding Lights listed below is 39.

Node layout and Mind Pearl costs are noted on the node map below, with node border colors matching the Guiding Light needed for unlocking that area.  For the meaning of each node, see [the Acronym/Node label description table](#wotm-acronymsnode-labels-table).

!!! warning
    The Well can be reset every 24 hours for free. You can reset it sooner than that for 100 green or purple Gems of Org. The skill, spell, proficiency, and class nodes are always in the same location. However, the stat and type change nodes reset randomly. For example, it is possible to have 3 Surety nodes on one reset and just 1 Surety node on another reset.

## Skill Improvement Values
The table below shows the stat increase per node taken.  For nodes that can be obtained multiple times, repeats may give reduced improvement as noted.

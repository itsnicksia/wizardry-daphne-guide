!!! warning
    Skill, spell, proficiency, and class nodes are always in the same location. Every time you reset the Well, however, stat and type change nodes reset.
    Sometimes they seem to change location, but other times they actually don't show up at all.
    For example, it is possible to have 3 Surety nodes on one reset and just 1 Surety node on another reset.

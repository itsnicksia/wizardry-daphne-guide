# Well of the Mind and Guiding Lights

## Well of the Mind

The Well of the Mind is a unique main character customization element accessible from the Ruins where you can unlock classes, skills, spells, and stat increases using "Mind Pearls".  

You start with 4 Mind Pearls. More are obtained by collecting ["Guiding Lights" through progressing in the main story](./well-of-the-mind#guiding-lights). Guiding lights are used by unlocking a color-matching clouded area of the Well after activating a node adjacent to that clouded area.  

Node layout and Mind Pearl costs are noted on the node map below, with node border colors matching the Guiding Light needed for unlocking that area.  For the meaning of each node, see [the Acronym/Node label description table]((./well-of-the-mind#wotm-acronym-node-labels-table)).

!!! warning
    Skill, spell, proficiency, and class nodes are always in the same location. Every time you reset the Well, however, content of stat and type change nodes reset randomly. For example, it is possible to have 3 Surety nodes on one reset and just 1 Surety node on another reset.

??? warning "Help, I'm Missing Guiding Lights!"
    If you met the requirements to obtain a guiding light but don't have it actually available in the Well for use, try exiting and restarting the game. Some of them seem to need a reboot to show up properly.

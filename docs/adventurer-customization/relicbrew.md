# Relicbrews

!!! warning "The list of effects are still being discovered! Please be patient"

Upon completion of [Recovery of Belongings](../abyss-guides/2-port-town-grand-legion/requests.md#recovery-of-belongings) and subsequently [Recovery of Research Materials](../abyss-guides/2-port-town-grand-legion/requests.md#recovery-of-belongings), you unlock the ability to access Relicbrews at the Black Barrel Tavern.

## How to obtain

Relicbrews can be obtained by finding abyss relics off of red glowing monsters anywhere in the game. They spawn randomly and typically are specific to their enemy type. The quality and thus exp given by a relic is randomized as well. Each relic produces 1 drink, which can be consumed by up to 6 people at once.

## Effects

These are essentially permanent buffs that can be applied to all adventurers including the MC. They typically provide some sort of stat buff at the cost of some reduction in another stat. There is a limit to these buffs in that after stacking a certain number of buffs, adventurers will begin taking more fortitude damage when dying (3-4) and even dropping to 0 fortitude when reaching 5 effects.

Effects can be increased by consuming the same type of brew again.

## Removal

These buffs can be removed through the surgery. On success, the adventurer will lose 1 max fortitude for 2 weeks. On failure, the adventurer will lose 5 max fortitude for 2 weeks. On great success, the adventurer does not lose any fortitude. It is recommended not to select emergency removal and only use special extraction. You can choose to use green gems, purple gems, or gold for removal, but it's generally recommended not to use any gems as of now.

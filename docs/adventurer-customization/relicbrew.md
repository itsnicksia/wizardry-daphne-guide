## How to Obtain Relics

Relics can be obtained by encountering relic monsters that can rarely appear anywhere in the game. 

- A relic monster will always drop a chest after a battle, which will contain either the enemy's relic (~30%) or slag (~70%).
- Slag can be exchanged for relics in the Black Barrel Tavern's Slagpiece Exchange.
- Relic monsters are unique and only one can spawn per encounter.

??? warning "Relic Monster Mechanics"

    - Encounters are rare (2%) and entirely RNG-dependent.
    - Increased HP (~30%) and potentially other stats.
    - Only enemies in the front row can be relic monsters.
    - Encounters are determined upon map entry. You cannot "farm" relics by running away, using stairs, or Harkens. To re-roll for potential encounters you must fully exit the map and reenter. 
    - Do not appear with any Guild Requests or Bounties that have NPC text before the battle. 
    - Can only drop its specific relic and not relics from other enemies.
    - Elemental variations will always drop the standard version's relic.
    - Relic ★ quality (1-5) is based on the level of the area. The vast majority of enemies will never drop a 4★ or 5★ relic even in late game areas.
    - Adventurers and Warped enemies (aside from White Gluttonous Maw) cannot drop relics.

### Relic Power

??? warning "Relic Power Mechanics"

    A Relic Power is received after drinking a relicbrew and has several unique properties: 
    
    - Increases 1-2 stats at the cost of another. The negative stat penalty is always -1 per level up to a maximum of -6.
    - Effects can be increased to a maximum of level 6 by repeatedly drinking the same relicbrew of any ★ quality.
    - Effects are hidden until the relicbrew has been consumed at least once.
    - Each has an alignment (Good-Neutral-Evil). 
    - Matching alignments with a unit give an additional, immediate bonus (or "extra" level) to the positive effects.
    - Up to to 3 Relic Powers can be active with no penalties. A 4th can be added safely if the alignments match.
    - Viewable in the status menu at the bottom of the Passive Skills list with a dark red star background.
    - Can be removed for a fee via extraction.
    - Level and accumulated experience is not lost if extracted, but you need to find and drink the same relicbrew again to reactivate.

    ??? tip "Menu Guide"
        <div align="center">
        ![](img/relicpower-extract.PNG)
        </div>

    - The Extraction service removes a currently equipped Relic Power for a fee.
    - There are 3 types of extraction services: Emergency, Standard, and Special.
    - An extracted Relic Power does not lose its level or accumulated experience, but must be reactivated with a new relicbrew of any ★ quality.

??? "Extraction Fortitude Penalty"

    When extracting a Relic Power there is a chance that something might go wrong and the adventurer will receive a temporary Fortitude penalty. 

    **Possible Extraction Outcomes**

    - Failure - Lose 5 max Fortitude for 2 weeks.
    - Success - Lose 1 max Fortitude for 2 weeks.
    - Great Success - No Fortitude loss.

    **Notes**
    
    - The more expensive extraction services have a lower rate of failure. 
    - A Fortitude penalty notification appear after the cutscene, if incurred.

??? "Payment Options"

    - Extraction services can be paid with purple gems, green gems, or gold.
    - No reason to use gems for extraction as the gold costs are generally affordable as you progress through the game.
    - Costs increase significantly (up to 100K) the higher the level of the Relic Power being removed.
    - Recommend to always use Special Extraction when possible.


### Slagpiece Exchange

The Slagpiece Exchange lists 12 relics for sale in exchange for slag that is reset and randomly determined each week. The amount of slag you have accumulated is shown in the upper right-hand corner.  

??? warning "Slagpiece Exchange Mechanics" 

    - Any relic in the game can appear, including one that is unique to the Exchange (Flower of the Abyss; MP and SP Up, ASPD Down).
    - There are 4 rows of varying ★ quality with 3 relics per row.
    - Standard costs per ★ quality:
        - 4★: 1000 slag
        - 3★: 400 slag
        - 2★: 200 slag
        - 1★: 100 slag
    - Relics unique to the shop have double the standard cost.
    - It is possible to have multiple copies of the same relic with different ★ quality.
    - You can refresh ("Reset") the Exchange with green or purple gems, which begins at 200 gems and doubles per refresh.

## Penalties

??? warning "Penalty Mechanics"

    - There is a limit to the number of Relic Powers an adventurer or the MC can have active at one time.
    - Any 3 Relic Powers can be equipped with no side effects.
    - A 4th can be safely added if the alignment (Good-Neutral-Evil) of the Relic Power and character match.
    - Adding additional Relic Powers beyond this limit incurs Stage 2 penalties immediately.
    - The Penalty Stage (0-3) is indicated by the color of the swirl in the top left corner of the character portrait in the Relic Powers and Drink Relicbrews menus.

| Penalty Stage | Color  | Effect                                                                                     |         
|:--------------| :------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Stage 0       | Grey   | None                                                                                       |   
| Stage 1       | White  | None                                                                                    |      
| Stage 2       | Purple | Fortitude reduced to 50 max. Chance to be afflicted with confusion at start of every turn. |      
| Stage 3       | Red    | Fortitude reduced to 0 max. Afflicted with confusion at start of every turn.               |      

??? "Penalty Stages"

    - Maximum Fortitude is instantly reduced at Stage 2 (50 Fortitude) and Stage 3 (0 Fortitude). There does not appear to be any other negative side effects outside of combat.
    - The success rate of enemy debuffs and status ailments increases significantly when Fortitude is below 50 and 20.
    - The MC has a hidden Fortitude value. The current, but not maximum, Fortitude can be viewed by your friends in the Tavern under Friendships.

    ??? tip "Recommendations"
    
        - Remove Relic Powers first before equipping new ones to avoid Fortitude penalties if planning to return to combat.
        - Use Nameless units to consume less desirable relicbrews to register the Relic Power effects in the Drink Relicbrews menu.

## Leveling Relic Powers

Relic Powers can be leveled like other passive skills. Instead of using inherits or codexes they require additional relics. For ease of reading, experience points (EXP) is the term that will be used throughout this section. 

??? warning "Experience Mechanics"

    - Each relic has an associated ★ quality that gives different amounts of Power Density, which function as experience points. 
    - Relic Powers require a certain amount of EXP to reach the next level with a maximum level of 7.
    - There is a "hidden" level 0 as it costs 100 EXP to equip a Relic Power. 
    - For example, if you used a 1★ relic, then the adventurer would have that Relic Power at level 1 with 0 EXP. This is the reason why you will often be exactly 100 EXP away from the next level.

##### Experience per Relic ★ Quality 

| ★ Quality  | EXP    |        
|:---------:|:------:|
| 1★         | 100   |
| 2★         | 200   |
| 3★         | 400   |
| 4★         | 1,000 |
| 5★         | 2,400 |


##### Required EXP per Relic Level

| Relic Power Level | EXP per Level | Total EXP |        
|:-----------------:|:------------:|:--------------:|
| 0 - 1             |     100      |      100       |
| 1 - 2             |     200      |      300       |
| 2 - 3             |     600      |      900       |
| 3 - 4             |     1,200    |      2,100     |
| 4 - 5             |     3,000    |      5,100     |
| 5 - 6             |     7,200    |      12,300    |
| Total             |     12,300   |        -       |

##### Minimum Relics per Level and ★ Quality

| ★ Quality  | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Level 4 | Level 5 | Level 6 |    
|:---------:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:-----:|:---:|:---:|
| 1★        |  1   |  3   |  9   |  21  |  51  | 72 | 
| 2★        |  1   |  2   |  5   |  11  |  26  | 36 | 
| 3★        |  1   |  1   |  3   |  6   |  13  | 18 | 
| 4★        |  1   |  1   |  1   |  3   |  6   | 8  | 
| 5★        |  1   |  1   |  1   |  1   |  3   | 3  | 

??? tip "How to read this table"

    - This table shows how many relics are needed per ★ quality to reach a specific level. These are total _not_ incremental numbers.
    - For example, to reach level 4 (2,100 total EXP) it would take 11, 2★ (200 EXP) relics (11 x 200 EXP = 2,200 EXP).
    - It is recommended to use the Slagpiece Exchange when possible to buy 1-2★ relics to reach level 4 or 5 to avoid wasting valuable EXP that could have gone to a different adventurer.

# Relicbrews

Upon completion of [Recovery of Belongings](../abyss-guides/2-port-town-grand-legion/requests.md#recovery-of-belongings) and subsequently [Recovery of Research Materials](../abyss-guides/2-port-town-grand-legion/requests.md#recovery-of-belongings), you unlock the ability to access Relicbrews at the Black Barrel Tavern.

## How to obtain

Relicbrews can be obtained by finding abyss relics on red glowing monsters anywhere in the game. They spawn randomly and typically are specific to their enemy type. Most importantly, only the frontmost row of enemies in a specific fight can spawn as relic-possessing monsters. The quality and thus exp given by a relic is dependant on the location of the enemy, usually scaling with the level of the area. Each relic produces 1 drink, which can be consumed by up to 6 people at once.

## Effects
Relic brews are stat buffs that can be applied to all adventurers. MC will always be included in the group of 6, but you can de-select him in the menu. All relic brew provide an increase to 1-2 stats at the cost of another. The effects can be increased to a maximum of level 5 by consuming the same type of brew multiple times. You do not lose experience if you remove them from a unit, but you need to find/drink the same relic brew again to reactivate it. If a unit's alignment (Good/Neutral/Evil) matches the relic brew they receive an additional, "free" level, which is front-loaded.

## Exp

- 1★ Relic = 100 EXP OR Lvl 1 with 0 EXP
- 2★ Relic = 200 EXP OR Lvl 1 with 100 EXP
- 3★ Relic = 400 EXP OR Lvl 2 with 100 EXP
- 4★ Relic = 1000 EXP OR Lvl 3 with 100 EXP

- 1★ to 2★ Requires 200 EXP
- 2★ to 3★ Requires 600 EXP
- 3★ to 4★ Requires 1200 EXP
- 4★ to 5★ Requires 3000 EXP

## Penalties

After gaining too many relic powers, an adventurer and the MC can suffer from certain debilitating effects in combat. Status is indicated by the color of the swirl on the top left of the character portrait, and the effect of different stages of impact arr listed below. Any character can safely have 3 active relic powers at one time.  A 4th power can be safely added if at least one of those four powers has the same personality type as the character. Exceeding these limits will raise an adventurer to Stage 2 side effects immediately. 

- Stage 0: Grey (Normal)
- Stage 1: White (Normal?)
- Stage 2: Purple (50 max fortitude, chance to be afflicted with confusion at start of every turn)
- Stage 3: Red (0 max fortitude, afflicted with confusion at start of every turn)

Note that there currently appears to be no negative effects outside of combat, and the safe limit apparently can be exceeded by any amount without impact as long as excess powers are removed before entering combat.

## Removal

Relic powers can be removed through the surgery at the tavern. (Select Relic Power from the main menu, then select the adventurer and power to remove.) On success, the adventurer will lose 1 max fortitude for 2 weeks. On failure, the adventurer will lose 5 max fortitude for 2 weeks. On great success, the adventurer does not lose any fortitude. It is recommended not to select emergency removal and only use special extraction. You can choose to use green gems, purple gems, or gold for removal, but it's generally recommended not to use any gems as of now.

Levels of removed powers are retained by that charater and will be restored to the same level if added again.

## Relic Slag Exchange Shop

The Relic Slag Exchange Shop lists 9 relicbrews for sale in exchange for slag on a weekly rotation. There are 3 rows of 3 relicbrews per row, with the top row being 3★, the middle row being 2★ relics, and the last row being 1★ relics. The relicbrews could be any known relic in the game. 3★ relics cost 400 slag, 2★ relics cost 200 slag, and 1★ relics cost 100 slag. You can refresh the shop with gems, which begins at 200 gems and doubles per refresh.

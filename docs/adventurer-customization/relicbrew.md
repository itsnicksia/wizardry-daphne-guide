## How to obtain relics

Relics can be obtained by encountering relic monsters that can rarely appear anywhere in the game. Upon defeat a relic monster will always drop a chest after a battle. The chest will spawn either the enemy's relic (~30%) or slag (~70%). Slag can be exchanged for relics in the Black Barrel Tavern's Slag Piece Exchange Shop. Relic monsters are unique and only one can spawn per encounter.

- Relic monster encounters are rare (2%) and entirely RNG-dependent.
- Relic monsters have increased HP (~30%)
- Only enemies in the front row can be relic monsters.
- Adventurers and Warped enemies (aside from the White Gluttonous Maw) cannot drop relics. 
- Relic monsters are determined upon map entry. You cannot "farm" relics by running away, using stairs, or Harkens. To re-roll for potential encounters you must fully exit the map and reenter. 
- Relic monsters do not appear with any Guild Requests or Bounties that have NPC text before the battle. 
- An enemy can only drop its specific relic and not relics from other enemies.
- Elemental variations of enemies will always drop the same relic.
- The ★ quality (1-4) of a relic is based on the level of the area. The vast majority of enemies will never drop a 4★ relic even in late game areas.  

<!-- maybe add image of a glowing common mob-->
<!-- what enemies drop 4 star relics-->
<!-- maybe add image with call outs for Relic Name, Relicpower, etc.--> 

## Black Barrel Tavern

At the Black Barrel Tavern the proprietor, Corvo the Alchemist, offers several different services.

| Services               | Details                                                                                                                                 |
|:-----------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Drink Relicbrew        | Transforms relics into relicbrews that give unique Relic Powers (passives) to your units.                                                |
| Relic Powers           | View each unit's currently equipped and extracted Relic Powers. Relic Powers can be extracted for a fee.                        |
| Slagpiece Exchange     | Trade slag for up to 9 randomly selected relics that refresh on a weekly basis.                                                          |
| Talk                   | Provides details on relic terms and history.                                                                                             |

### Drink Relicbrew

The "Relicbrew" menu lists all of the relics in your inventory. Note that the same relic with a different ★ quality is counted as a separate item and relicbrew. Selecting a relic will show you the name of the relicbrew, a brief description, and its associated Relic Power, if known. Each relicbrew provides a unique Relic Power in the form of a passive skill.

**Relic Powers**

- Increases 1-2 stats at the cost of another (always -1 per level).
- Effects are hidden until the relicbrew has been consumed at least once.
- Effects can be increased to a maximum of level 5 by repeatedly drinking the same relicbrew of any ★ quality.
- Have alignments (Good/Neutral/Evil). Matching alignments with a unit gives an additional, immediate bonus (or "extra" level) to the positive effects.
- Each unit can safely equip up to 3 Relic Powers with no side effects. A 4th can be added if the alignments match.
- Located at the bottom of a unit's Passive Skill list with its current level and a dark red star icon.
- Level and accumulated experience is not lost if extracted, but you need to find and drink the same relicbrew again to reactivate it.

Once a relicbrew has been chosen hit the "Order" button to continue. 

The "Drink Relicbrew" menu shows you a list of all available units, the number of equipped Relic Powers, side effect status, and Relic Power history via a small bottle icon over their class name. A golden bottle denotes a currently equipped Relic Power. A dark grey (empty) bottle means it was extracted in the past. This icon can help you sort through a large roster to find the correct units. Up to 6 people can consume a relicbrew, but the MC is always a fixed member that can be de-selected in the menu. To consume the relicbrew select "Drink Relicbrew" at the bottom of the menu to view a brief cutscene. Congrats, enjoy your newfound powers of the Abyss!   

### Relic Powers

When you select a unit a new menu, "Relic Power", will appear that shows the currently equipped Relic Powers, level, and whether the alignment matches (bright pink text). You can click on any Relic Power to see its current level, effect description, and "Power Density", which functions as an experience bar. The "Extracted Relic Power" section shows the unit's previously equipped Relic Powers. 

**Extraction**

This is the primary service you will be using, which allows you to extract (remove) a currently equipped Relic Power. To extract, click on the Relic Power and select "Remove Power". There are 3 types of extraction services: Emergency, Standard, and Special. The more expensive options have a higher chance of success. On success, the adventurer will lose 1 max Fortitude for 2 weeks. On failure, the adventurer will lose 5 max Fortitude for 2 weeks. On great success, the adventurer does not lose any fortitude. 

The extraction services can be paid for with purple gems, green gems, and gold. There is no reason to use gems for extraction as the gold costs are generally affordable as you progress through the game. However, the costs increase the higher the level of the Relic Power being removed. We recommend that you always use Special Extraction when possible. Please remember that an extracted Relic Power does not lose its level or accumulated experience, but must be reactivated with a new relicbrew.

### Slagpiece Exchange

The Slagpiece Exchange Shop lists 9 relicbrews for sale in exchange for slag on a weekly rotation. There are 3 rows of 3 relicbrews per row, with the top row being 3★, the middle row being 2★ relics, and the last row being 1★ relics. The relicbrews could be any known relic in the game. 3★ relics cost 400 slag, 2★ relics cost 200 slag, and 1★ relics cost 100 slag. You can refresh the shop with gems, which begins at 200 gems and doubles per refresh.

## Leveling Relic Powers

Relic Powers can be leveled like other passive skills. Instead of using inherits or codexes they require additional relics (transformed into relicbrews). Each relic has an associated ★ quality that gives different amounts of Power Density, which function as experience points (EXP). This is the term (EXP) that will be used throughout this section.       

| ★ Quality | EXP |        
|:----------:|:-----:|
| 1★         | 100   |
| 2★         | 200   |
| 3★         | 400   |
| 4★         | 1,000 |

Each Relic Power requires a certain amount of EXP to reach the next level. The maximum is level 5. A quirk of this system is that there is a "hidden" level 0 as it costs 100 EXP to equip a Relic Power. For example, if you used a 1★ relic, then the adventurer would have that Relic Power at level 1 with 0 EXP. This is the reason why you will often be exactly 100 EXP away from the next skill level.  After level 3 the EXP required to take a Relic Power to level 4 (1,200 EXP) or level 5 (3,000 EXP) is significant so plan accordingly. Note that it takes 900 total EXP to reach level 3 and 2,100 EXP to reach level 4.    

| Relic Power Level | Required EXP | Cumulative EXP |        
|:-----------------:|:------------:|:--------------:|
| 0 - 1             |     100      |      100       |
| 1 - 2             |     200      |      300       |
| 2 - 3             |     600      |      900       |
| 3 - 4             |     1,200    |      2,100     |
| 4 - 5             |     3,000    |      5,100     |
| Total             |     5,100    |        -       |

Below is a summary table to give you an idea of how many relics you would have to collect per ★ quality to reach a specific level. These are total _not_ incremental numbers. For example, to reach level 4 (2,100 total EXP) it would take 11, 2★ (200 EXP) relics (11 x 200 EXP = 2,200 EXP). Take advantage of the Slagpiece Exchange to buy 1-2★ relics to reach the next level, especially for level 5 to avoid wasting EXP that could have gone to a different adventurer.     

| ★ Quality | Lv 1 | Lv 2 | Lv 3 | Lv 4 | Lv 5 |   
|:---------:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:-----:|:---:|
| 1★        |  1   |  3   |  9   |  21  |  51  |
| 2★        |  1   |  2   |  5   |  11  |  26  | 
| 3★        |  1   |  1   |  3   |  6   |  13  |
| 4★        |  1   |  1   |  1   |  3   |  6   |

## Penalties

After gaining too many Relic Powers, an adventurer and the MC can suffer from certain debilitating effects in combat. Status is indicated by the color of the swirl on the top left of the character portrait, and the effect of different stages of impact are listed below. Any character can safely have 3 active Relic Powers at one time.  A 4th power can be safely added if at least one of those four powers has the same alignment type as the character. Exceeding these limits will raise an adventurer to Stage 2 side effects immediately. 

- Stage 0: Grey (Normal)
- Stage 1: White (Normal?)
- Stage 2: Purple (50 max fortitude, chance to be afflicted with confusion at start of every turn)
- Stage 3: Red (0 max fortitude, afflicted with confusion at start of every turn)

Note that there currently appears to be no negative effects outside of combat, and the safe limit apparently can be exceeded by any amount without impact as long as excess powers are removed before entering combat.

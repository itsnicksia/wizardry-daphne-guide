## ^^Enhance^^
 - Increases Enhancement Value up to a maximum of +20.
 - Increases Innate Attributes
 - At Enhancement Value +5, +10, +15 and +20, unlocks a new Blessing or improves an existing Blessing if one already exists in that slot.
 - Enhancing beyond  +5, +10, and +15 requires unification (see below) to increase Strength of the item.

Requires **Gold** and **Iron Ore**.

commenting this out until we have data lol this is so sad

### ^^Enhancement Values^^

|                                               |  1★ |  2★ | 3 ★ |  4★ |  5★ |
|:---------------------------------------------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:----:|:----:|
|     **ATK, MAG, DIV, DEF, MDEF, ACC, EVA**    | 1~3 | 2~6 | 3~9 | 4~12 | 5~15 |
| **ATK%, MAG%, DIV%, DEF%, MDEF%, ACC%, EVA%** | 1~3 | 2~6 | 3~9 | 4~12 | 5~15 |

|                   **ASPD%**                   | 1~1 | 1~2 | 1~3 |  1~4 | 1~5  |

-->

## ^^Refine^^

Refining an item increases the value of a substat **Blessing** and requires a matching Refinement Stone of the same blessing to improve. Every blessing on an item can be refined, but only one refinement stone can be applied to each blessing.  Subsequent refinements replace previous refinements. Potential refinement range is shown prior to using the stone.

As of version 1.12.1, refinement bonuses are retained if you enhance to a level that also enhances that atteibute. Previously, if refined before enhancing to +5, +10, +15, or +20, the enhancement would clear any refinement on the assocated substat, which depending on the values rolled could make attribute value appear to get worse on enhancement.

Blacksmithing becomes available early in the game after your party enters the first major city, Royal Capital Luknalia.

## ^^Extraction^^

Extracting destroys an item, with a small chance of producing an Alteration Stone or Refinement Stone that can be used to modify or increase substats on items.

The type of stone produced will be randomly selected from one of the substats on the item under extraction. The refinement/alteration values of the stones will be higher when produced from higher star-value items.

Only weapons, armor and accessories can be extracted.

### ^^Extraction Values^^

**These values may be inaccurate, and should be treated as estimates.**

|                                               |  1★ | 2 ★ | 3 ★ | 4 ★ | 5 ★ |
|:---------------------------------------------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|     **ATK, MAG, DIV, DEF, MDEF, ACC, EVA**    | 1~3 | 2~4 | 3~5 | 4~6 | 5~7 |
| **ATK%, MAG%, DIV%, DEF%, MDEF%, ACC%, EVA%** | 1~2 | 1~3 | 2~4 | 3~5 | 3~6 |
|                 **ASPD, SUR**                 | 1~2 | 2~3 | 3~4 | 3~5 | 4~6 |
|                   **ASPD%**                   | 1~2 | 1~3 | 2~4 | 3~5 | 3~6 |

## ^^Alteration^^

Altering an item modifies a substat, and requires an Alteration Stone.

Alteration has some nuanced behavior to it.

* Altering a slot after it reached its checkpoint will remove both the initial Blessing and any enhancements and refinements, leaving the slot with just the value provided by the Alteration Stone.

* Any enhancement performed after alteration will improve belessing values a usual.

## ^^Enhancement Inheritance^^

Enhancement Inheritance sacrifices an existing enhanced item to increase the enhancement value of another item.

This only works for items of the same type (one-handed weapons to one-handed weapons, shoes to shoes, etc).

This helps save gold + ore when changing to higher quality equipment when you have already enhanced your existing equipment.

The resulting enhancement level will depend on the material and enhancement level of the sacrificed item relative to the item being enhanced. The expected outcome is shown after selecting the item to be sacrificed.

Enhancement inheritance comes with a small chance of an excellent or poor outcome that will result in one extra or one less level of enhancement.

You can inherit an enhancement level higher than an item can reach if its Strength or unification level is not high enough (see Unification below). If that is the expected level, the value will be shown as something like `5 (7!)`.  Upon increasing the item's unification strength to accommodate the higher level, the item's enhancement will automatically be increased. 

## ^^Unification^^

## ^^Advanced Blacksmithing^^

### ^^Advanced Extraction^^

The star quality of an item being extracted determines the magnitude of the stones produced. 

Extracting higher quality items results in a larger bonus granted by the stones.

**Tip:** Altering a high quality item with a low-grade Stone and then extracting the resulting item will result in a higher quality Stone, as the game only considers **item quality** and **type of available substats** when generating a Stone, not the magnitude of the substats.

### ^^Full Alteration^^

![](img/samurai-meme.png)

A **Full Alteration Stone** allows you to reroll all unlocked substats on an item.

!!! note "Known Ways to Obtain"
    - Very VERY rare chance from extracting ANY grade/quality gear.
    - As of April 1st, 2025, can be purchased from the monthly pack: ^^Jeweler Curated Collection Set^^ for 74.99 USD.
    - From Old Castle Ruins Event Shop for 10000 event tokens.
    - Occasionally appear in Limited-Time Offers as an exclusive sale item in packs during events.

It re-rolls all blessings currently on an item. This process is subject to the same RNG that all items are subject to when generating stats on Reversal from junk. It also applies a bonus amount to each blessing; similar to the same check point that you would normally receive when enhancing an item to +5/10/15/20. This allows you to "double-dip" on stats when enhancing a piece of gear altered with FAS if it hasn't been enhanced already. Using this method will allow gear to receive stats significantly higher than naturally possible, even in ideal circumstances.

As of Update 1.12.1, Full Alteration Stones will now also re-apply Milestone Blessing bonuses on applicable items (The game will remember the item's Grade or Color), so it is now feasible to use these on items that are already +20. However, it only re-applies those blessings on rolls that are generated by the stone itself and not ones altered after.

Using a SECOND FAS on the same item repeats the process - it will again re-roll all blessings while unlocking an alteration slot, even if you had altered previously.

!!! note "Example 1: Using One Full Alter Stone"
    ![](img/fas-subject-1.png)

!!! note "Example 1: Using Two Full Alter Stones"
    ![](img/fas-subject-2.png)

As of Update 1.12.1, Lesser Full Alteration Stones have been added that re-rolls the stats but does not apply re-apply Milestone Blessings. They drop more frequently than Full Alteration Stones, but are still quite rare. 

It is highly suggested that a FAS should be saved and used on your highest rarity items - 4 star purple or higher. Good examples for this would the Master Fighter Ring from the Fighter Proving Grounds (A 4 star Red Ring) or certain extremely strong gacha equipment like Blade Cuisinart if they have a good quality/grade. Alternatively, it can be used to give another chance at better rolls on gear that has already been enhanced to +20 if the item has generated with a decent Grade (color).

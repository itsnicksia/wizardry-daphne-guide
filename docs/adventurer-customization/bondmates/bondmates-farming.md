# Bondmate Levelling

## Bondmate Levels

The number of times you need to get a bond to reach a particular bond level:

| Level | Bonds for Level | Total number of Bonds |
| :---: | :-------------: | :-------------------: |
|  1    |  1              | 1                     |
|  2    |  1              | 2                     |
|  3    |  2              | 4                     |
|  4    |  3              | 7                     |
|  5    |  4              | 11                    |

!!! note "Reacquiring a bondmate that has already reached level 5 will instead result in being given an Amnesia Incense, used for severing all bondmates from one character so that they can be bonded to someone else.  One Amnesia Incense can be farmed weekly from each bondmate by following the same procedure as for obtaining the bondmates."

!!! note "Certain bondmates are permanently capped at level 1 and further attempts to acquire the bond will just produce a 'will be missed' message."

!!! note "As of the June 2025 update, bondmates obtained through story progression can no longer be 'dismissed'."

## Beginning Abyss Bondmates

Using the Cursed Wheel, "Leaping" back to Fresh Start will reset most bondmate locations, and then immediately "Leaping" forward to Warped Scene or later will make most bondmate requests available again. 

!!! note "Special Cases"

    ??? note "Pleading Boss Goblin"
    You should only try adding the Goblin Den to this cycle if you can survive the Ambushes and/or avoid most mobile enemy fights. The enemies scale based on your grade, so recommend saving for levels 30 or 40 (or later) and bringing enough mage support to clear goblins groups. Also, note that this will one additional Cursed Wheel cycle, as the first visit to the den only involves fighting the Northeast goblin group. See the [Pleading Boss Goblin bondmate procedures](./beginning-abyss/bondmates.md#the-pleading-boss-goblin).

    ??? note "Albano"
    After earning the Albano bondmate by [completing the Beginning Abyss "Perfect Ending"](./beginning-abyss/bondmates.md#royal-knight-albano), repeat bonds are obtainable simply by Wheeling back to any point before "The King's Rescue", then leaping forward to "The King's Rescue" or later, and finally going to the Edge of Town screen in the Royal Capital.  The Albano Bondmate interaction should begin automatically, and can be raised from level 1 to 5 in a matter of minutes. (Confirmed as of version 1.8.0.  This did intermittantly stop working in prior versions, but currently appears to be expected behavior.)

!!! note "Several bondmates below require gaining specific Knowledge before the bondmate paths can be followed. See individual bondmate pages for [Chris](./beginning-abyss/bondmates.md#chris-the-considerate), [Mudd](./beginning-abyss/bondmates.md#mudd-the-eternal-novice), and [Donato](./beginning-abyss/bondmates.md#donato-the-king-of-debt) for steps to follow before farming."

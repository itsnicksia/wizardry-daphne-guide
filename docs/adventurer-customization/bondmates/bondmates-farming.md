## Beginning Abyss Bondmates

Using the Cursed Wheel, "Leaping" back to Fresh Start will reset most bondmate locations, and then immediately "Leaping" forward to Warped Scene or later will make most bondmate requests available again. 

!!! note "Pleading Boss Goblin"
You should only try adding the Goblin Den to this cycle if you can survive the Ambushes and/or avoid most mobile enemy fights. The enemies scale based on your grade, so recommend saving for levels 30 or 40 (or later) and bringing enough mage support to clear goblins groups. Also, note that this will one additional Cursed Wheel cycle, as the first visit to the den only involves fighting the Northeast goblin group. See the [Pleading Boss Goblin bondmate procedures](./beginning-abyss/bondmates.md#the-pleading-boss-goblin).

!!! note "Albano"
After earning the Albano bondmate by [completing the Beginning Abyss "Perfect Ending"](./beginning-abyss/bondmates.md#royal-knight-albano), repeat bonds are obtainable simply by Leaping forward each time to "The King's Rescue" or later and going to the Royal Capital Edge of Town screen in the Royal Capital where the Albano Bondmate interaction should begin automatically. (Confirmed as of version 1.8.0.  This did intermittantly stop working in prior versions, but currently appears to be expected behavior.)

# Bondmate Levelling

## Beginning Abyss Bondmates

Using the Cursed Wheel, Leaping back to Fresh Start will reset most bondmate locations, and then immediately Leaping forward to Warped Scene will make most bondmate Requests available.  To hit most of the bondmates, after leaping to Warped Scene:

1. Step right back up stairs to B7F, step into teleporter, return to Harken
2. Leap to B5F - revive Harry and Ira.
3. Return to town.  Visit Temple for Ira, pay 500G.
4. Go to Guild and accept Beheading Bunny, Save the Grandchildren, and Donato Requests.
5. Enter Abyss Entrance, take stairs to B1F.  Speak to Chris and Mudd. Complete Chris and Donato requests.
6. Harken to B3F. Rescue Mudd.
7. Harken to B4F. Complete all four rounds of Bunny request, get bond.  Rescue Mudd again, get bond.
8. Stairs down to B5F. Complete Grandchildren request. (Automatically return to town.)
9. Go to guild, turn in three requests. Get Donato and Mel bonds.  Optional - accept Abyss Heretics request.
10. Enter Abyss, B5F, step down to B6F. Go through full level reviving Harry when you see him.
11. Return to town. Visit Ira at Temple, pay 500G.
12. Enter Abyss, B7F, go find Harry one more time. Get bond.
13. Return to town. Visit Ira at Temple, get bond.
14. Guild - accept Undead March quest.
15. Enter Abyss to B7F, win all 4 undead waves. Get bond. (Automatically return to town.)
16. Repeat Cursed Wheel Leaps.

Optional - Add Goblin Den to B3F part of cycle if you can avoid most fights and survive the Ambushes. (Recommend saving for levels 30 or 40.) Adding that or Albano to this gets very complicated.  Probably best to focus leveling each on their own.

!!! note "Albano"
It's potentially possible to wheel ahead to The King's Rescue after step 15 then go to the edge of town to get Albano. This was possible, then it was not possible, then it was possible again, so we're not completely sure which is the intended behavior.

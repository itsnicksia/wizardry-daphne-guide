Alex was born the fifth son of a lord who ruled over a remote area far away from the capital that had more animals and birds than it had people.

As a child, Alex was fascinated by a knight of his bedtime stories. With just his sword, the hero saved a kingdom and earned the adoration of its princess. Alex looked up to that knight and, after turning 10, decided to become the greatest knight in the kingdom.

Though his father wanted him to serve as secretary, Alex's passion was too great to ignore, and Alex was allowed to join the most demanding group of knights in the area. His father had assumed that Alex would come running back, but Alex excelled at training and became the best knight in the order.

Alex told his father that he wanted to put his sword skills to use and join the Royal Knights. His father strongly objected, telling Alex lay down his sword in return for the freedom he'd enjoyed all his life. This unprecedented argument prompted Alex to leave his family home.

The Royal Knights of the capital held an open call to recruit new members only once every three years.

However, it took Alex two months to arrive there, and recruitment had ended the week prior.

"What am I to do now for three years? I can't go back home."

Finding himself at a complete loss, he took his last bit of travelling money and went into a tavern to drown his sorrows. A worker there heard his drunken rambling and spoke to him.

"You know, if you're good enough, you could always become an adventurer of the guild."

Having no other options, the drunken Alex registered at the guild and the next thing he knew, he was an adventurer.

Though his life as an adventurer of the guild began with this impromptu decision, he excelled at his missions thanks to the rigorous knight training he had completed.

His fellow adventurers, though skilled, were not always the most polite. This offended Alex, but he grew used to it. Alex's integrity along with his swordsmanship built up his credibility and reputation as an adventurer.

Still, his admiration for the Royal Knights never faded.

"Royal Knight recruitment is only a year and a half away. I'll surely get be accepted on the first try. For that to happen, I must further my skills and build my reputation."

To this day, Alex takes on the most difficult requests as a form of training.

Heinrico's father was born in a hidden elven village in the northern reaches of the continent of Valeon and lived his life as a roving hunter. With the opening of the Abyss, the continent was thrown into turmoil. Seeking safer lands, he made his way south, and yet further south until, finally, he escaped the cursed continent by ship and reached a new land across the sea.

The land was green and fair, its people radiant with life and vitality. To his weary eyes, hardened by his journey across the blasted continent, it shone with a brilliance almost painful to behold. In the heart of the ancient forest, he beheld a human woman, and love, swift and deep, took hold of his heart. And in the fullness of time, Heinrico was born into the world.

His mother saw that her son was guided in the knowledge of the wilderness, teaching him the deep, vital secrets of how to flourish beneath the jungle canopy: the diverse forms and behaviors of the animals, the flowering plants, and the creeping insects; the sacred methods for the full use of all collected bounty; and the perilous knowledge of which gave nourishment, and which held poison. From his father Heinrico learned the bow, treading the deep woods, foraging and taking prey in the wild, thereby making his parents' teachings a part of his own flesh and blood.

Just when Heinrico thought he had come to know the forest of his birth completely, his mother died. He had known that the lifespan of a human was dreadfully short. Yet it was then, through the full weight of experience, that he truly came to understand.

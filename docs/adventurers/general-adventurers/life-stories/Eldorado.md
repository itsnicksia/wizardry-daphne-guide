Eldorado was the second son of a distinguished family of knights in an elven kingdom to the north. He strove to become a knight from a very young age, following the lead of his father and older brother.  

After becoming an squire, Eldorado trained diligently. Yet his family, viewing his becoming a knight as a given, never appreciated his hard work.  

One day, Eldorado, now a knight, performed well in a contest of skill. The spectating king offered him praise. This was the first time his efforts had been recognized, and it gave him great pleasure and satisfaction.

The king was an upright and benevolent man, and Eldorado idolized him. Serving the king became a source of pride and joy for him.  

However, his days of happiness soon came to an end when an Abyss opened in a neighboring country south of the kingdom. The country moved quickly, seeking to gain new territory to replace that lost to the Abyss. The invasion was lightning-quick, and the moderate king was left trying to keep up.  

The king fought back, but to no avail. He was slain in battle, his kingdom falling with him.

Lamenting that he had not been able to protect his beloved king, Eldorado and a few of his companions set out on a journey of vengeance.  

Burning with devotion, Eldorado swore to avenge all.  

With whatever little clues he could find, he hunted his quarry for years, showing no mercy to any involved in the destruction of the kingdom.  

About 60 years after beginning their bloodquest, his companions called for an end to it. Their revenge had mostly been carried out, and those they had not found were likely already dead regardless. But Eldorado strongly disagreed, stating that any dwarves or elves would still be left. "Is this the extent of your loyalty?!"  

Among Eldorado's companions was his older brother, who counseled him to begin rebuilding the kingdom together, but not even his family's words could reach through his rigid sense of loyalty. Eldorado continued down his path of vengeance alone.

And finally, decades later, he had achieved his revenge over all those responsible. At the end of it all, however, there was nothing to be gained.  

Having lost his purpose, Eldorado kept thinking back to his days as a knight in the service of the king. And so he realized that he needed to find someone new to pledge allegiance to.  

He was determined to search for a new lord, but as yet, no lord has met his expectations.  

Perhaps there will never be one who surpasses the king of his homeland, glorified in his memories. Eldorado's search for this new lord continues to this day.

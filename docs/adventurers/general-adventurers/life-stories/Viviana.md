Viviana was an unwanted child, born to a slum bar prostitute in the royal capital who did not know who her father was.

She always yearned for her mother's love, but her mother seldom returned home and would always be drunk when she did. Neglected by the one who gave birth to her, Viviana grew up in the embrace of hunger, anxiety, and loneliness.

One day, unable to bear the pangs of hunger any longer, Viviana stole a small piece of bread from a street stall. After desperately fleeing from the angry stall keeper's shouts, Viviana, who had devoured the bread to save her own life, learned to steal as a way of survival.

She knew getting caught would be the end of her, and although many considered theft immoral, it was the only way she knew to survive. And so she began honing her skills so that no one would ever be able to catch her.

But, one day, she was caught by an older man as she tried to pick the pocket of a drunkard.

Under the man's sharp eyes, Viviana fell to her knees on the cobblestones, crestfallen and convinced she would either be beaten or taken before the guards, but the man praised her instead.

"Pretty nimble for a runt. You've got promise."

The man himself was a thief, and he presented Viviana with a choice. Either be turned in for stealing, or aid him in his own thievery.

Viviana chose to go with the man. It was the first time in her life anyone had ever praised her, and that was more important to her than anything in the world.

After a few years of assisting in the work as an apprentice, Viviana was praised by her master and improved her skills with surprising speed. It occurred to her how long it had been since she'd returned home but ultimately it mattered nothing to her.

At the end of her training, Viviana officially joined the Thief's Guild. Although her slight frame made her a poor brawler, her deft hands and agility where highly-prized by her companions.

Sometimes, when returning from jobs and making her way through the back alleys of the capital, she would see prostitutes soliciting business from passers-by and remember her mother.

All that came to mind was the deliberate neglect, the stench of alcohol, and how worn she always looked. Now that Viviana had chosen life a thief, she knew there was no reason for her to return to see her mother. The embers of her yearning had faded, and there was nothing in her herat or mind to rekindle it anymore.

## Adventurer Reviews

??? info "Shiro's Analysis"

    Starting with her passive, likewise as Elise she’s a totem that buff your teammate. This time it’s an evil one though. Looking at how many evil front options we have as for now it’s a great choice to pick her in your team if you have a slot just for this.

    Moving to her discipline. It helps a bit with her bulk and can save you up to a whole 2 more ASPD! Which… is nothing-by itself alone. But on the bright side her both inheritances are quite useless so it’s worth it to discipline her because you’re losing grade tags in the worst case. 

    Her class change is a mage. And that’s where the fun begins. Miliana as a dark-elf-female has the perfect setup to be a mage. Which means she’s one of best backlane choices to buff further your Gerulf/Galbados or whoever you use. 

    To sum it up. We have access to dark elf mage which is great for later parts of the game. On top of all while her SPD buffs are small she benefits from not only thief passive and discipline but also access to Arboris buff in back row. While those are small things it all adds up making her speed tuning slightly easier. On top of all she's a great option to bring to boss fights because while she’s not as good as Alice she’s still your second best option if you’re not using Madam buff. Not only will she buff your evil ally while having a perfect mage setup like Sheli. But on top of that you’re not risking that she’ll get hit with sleep status in a really long fight. Which makes her safer and better. If you’re looking for a general adventurer for your evil party then Milana is your pick! You can’t go wrong with her there. Her only downside is lack of access to priest class. But that won’t be an issue if you run Alice and Arobis along in the backlane.

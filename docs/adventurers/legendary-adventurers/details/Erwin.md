## Adventurer Reviews

??? info "TheAxolotl's Analysis"

    Every now and then, an adventurer comes along that makes you really question what the devs are doing. Welcome, Erwin!

    Looking at his skills, Flames of Gluttony is...weird, both conceptually and mechanically. Conceptually, we have a single target spell that gets stronger the more enemies you're facing. What's problematic about this is generally when you're facing multiple enemies, you're not going to want to be using single target spells - you'll want to either use MA/LA spells or use crowd control such as KATINO or KANTIOS. From early testing, the damage boost per enemy does not seem to be a linear percentage increase. The variability of damage in general makes it hard to determine, but first glance looks something like a smaller damage increase per enemy when facing 1-3 enemies, then larger increase per enemy at 4+ enemies. Since this is from inherited testing, you can assume an additional ~33% or so more damage if you're using him directly, which is...fine.

    Unlike TZALIK and True Words of Fire, this spell does not seem to have a lowered Surety threshold, which is unfortunate but expected.

    His passive, Spellcraft Bookmark, is roughly a non-compounding 2 MP reduction starting on turn 2 of using the same spell in a row, regardless of the spell. It's damage increase is also a non-compounding 10% or so.

    His Discipline is what you'd expect for a mage - Magic Power and MP. Nothing massive, but all around fine.

    So what does this amount to? An overall lackluster legendary that gives us great incentive to save for the new class near the end of the year. Of all the great things they could have done with a new legendary mage, this is confusing and not really one of them.

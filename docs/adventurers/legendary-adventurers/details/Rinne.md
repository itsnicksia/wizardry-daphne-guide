## Adventurer Reviews

??? info "TheAxolotl's Analysis"

    Rinne is our first legendary ninja, and she's an incredible way to introduce the class. In addition to the ninja skill kit, which is already strong, Rinne has a few really big standouts.

    Enlightenment of the Brink of Death is the first true support we get for an Evil MC (and Evil characters in general). While the magnitude is tricky to determine, increasing Surety is always good. The buff will always be active for her, and "adjacent" in this game means on either side, as well as in front or behind. This gives her a lot of versatility in terms of position placement. Right now, the prime targets for her buff are an Evil MC, Gerulf, and Milana. This actually enables us to run aa full Evil party that could consist of Evil MC, Rinne, and Gerulf in the front row, and Milana, Alice, and Adam in the back row. This party would have both rows buffed by Alice, Milana providing an additional damage buff to the Evil MC, and Rinne providing a Surety buff to Evil MC, herself, and Gerulf in the front. One important thing to note is that she will always receive the Surety buff from this skill - it won't disappear if she's surrounded by Neutral or Good adventurers.

    Moment of Finality is a very unique ability. It is a skill that deals untyped spell damage on an entire enemy row, which initially is pretty solid, but is made stronger by the fact that it bypasses the enemy Magic Defense AND is based on Attack Power instead of Magic Power. Based on the skill details, the Magic Defense bypass rate is increased based on skill level, so while this needs testing, it likely behaves in the same way that Precision Strike and Armor Pierce do, but targeting Magic Defense instead of Defense. This gives a fantastic way for Rinne to get around high defense enemies, and it also gives us one of our first row attacks based on Attack Power. Furthermore, since it's based on SP, inheriting Debra to Rinne will allow for a boost to longevity through restoring SP on kill. This skill is likely not as valuable when inherited due to the damage loss, however it is a solid target for duplicate usage on Rinne herself.

    Rinne's Inheritor of the Secret Arts Discipline skill is also pretty solid in that it boosts her Surety, which is always welcome.

    In addition to the all-Evil party I mentioned above, Rinne can fit in a variety of teams, and she can function well in either the front row with Daggers or in the back row with Throwing Ninja Tools. She can also use Ninja Katanas effectively, as of release, we don't know if the Katanas are treated as Daggers for the Ninja Dual Wield skill or not. She can provide damage, support, and all around general utility with the other great Ninja active and passive skills.

    While Rinne herself may not be a meta-defining adventurer, the Ninja class initially seems extremely strong and Rinne provides enough uniqueness with her kit to make me highly recommend her as a pull target for those that have been saving their gems for a while.

??? info "Frobro's Analysis"

    Warning to newer players, ninjas are cool but are not for you. Their high EXP requirements will keep them under-leveled relative to the rest of your party. By the time your non-advanced classes reach lvl 60, your ninja will be at lvl 46. Veteran players have access to potent exp dispatches that can get one from level 0 to 60 in ~11 days. This martial training dispatch becomes available at Abyss 3 Zone 5. Don’t let the newly added ninja junk in fool you, you woun’t get access to solid ninja junk until you unlock the cave in Abyss 3.

    Now to Rinne specifically. Because of the potency drop when inherited, Moment of Finality is really only useful when used by her, which gives her a niche as the only non-mage multitarget attacker at present. However, the skill is kinda costly at 15SP, which means it isn’t the kind of skill you can use very often. Rinne only gets 1 recovery event if multiple units die to Moment of Finality from inheriting Debra’s Sp regen skill. Thanks to the 2-hand weapon buff, when made into a thief with a bow, Moment of finality can do some solid damage when geared right (a lot of atk blessings). Rinne also has a relatively deep pool of MP with nothing to use it on naturally. I suppose you could use her in a buffer/debuffer role by using premium scrolls like Batilgref/Dilto/Marein/Masolotu/Cortu from the daily shop on her.

    Her Enlightenment at the Brink of Death passive gives her and adjacent Evil units free surety. Stuff like this is why Evil is drowning and Good is starving. The surety & accuracy discipline is potent for Dual Wielding Daggers or Kunai; no complaints.

    Right now, ninjas are flashy but take a lot of investment and junk grinding to compare with fighters. Now that MC gets access to Ninja, things are even worse for Rinne as we don’t need her for Dissipation and her use case shrinks even more. An inspired voice performance and a top 5 character model on a kinda middling unit.

    Starting with inheritance. It's a spell. So you need to have a lot of surety to hit surety hits on it. But it scales with ATK. It's kind of disappointing for me why it didn’t get the TZALIK treatment but looking at how strong it’s I guess it’s fair. Because it puts mages high lvl MA spells to a shame even at lvl 1.

    Moving to passive. It’s solid. Surety but only for evil characters. Would be better if that includes neutral but it’s what it’s.

    Moving to discipline. It’s great. ACC is kind of fine but SUR makes it really worth the investment when you’re going to max out Rinne. Especially since thanks to her classes she’ll have a good bunch of surety letting her to get close to hit surety with her AoE or have stable surety hits on bosses.

    Her class change is a thief. Back in the day, it was the worse option, that was nowhere close to ninja. Now? It’s her better choice. Even if you have the most crazy ebon kunai they won’t be hitting as hard as a bow. Bow scaling with skill at this moment completely outshine kunai giving a lot of damage difference on skills. So unless you use her for basic attacks only or you have a high lvl Ninja Dual Wield then it’s not worth going for her ninja class. Especially when bows are much easier to farm.

    To sum it up. Rinne has a great class setup, She has great inheritance, she has great discipline, and her passive is solid. On top of that she has a dark element resulting in good state in the late part of abyss 3 fights. She's a solid investment and arguably the best thief and ninja option as for now. And unless devs won’t come with anything crazy she’s quite safe from risk of powercreep. It’s also a good idea to grab MoF on your fighters to make farming a bit faster with AoE spam. Otherwise go ahead and invest in Rinne.

## Adventurer Pull Plans

??? note "TheAxolotl's Pull Plan"
    While I'm not a whale, Rinne has easily been my biggest banner investment. I pulled enough to get a base copy, an OCD inherit, as well as level 3 Moment of Finality on both Rinne and my MC. In the process, I managed to get one extra copy to take her Discipline up to D2 since I didn't have anything else to really use it on.

??? note "Lynd's Pull Plan"
    Would've pulled if I was around. I miss her and I've never even met her. Come back soon please.

## Duplicate Usage

* Inherit on her own skill will increase the damage and Magic Defense bypass of her Moment of Finality skill. Note that as with all increased skill levels, the SP cost will increase, so inheriting a few Debra's to her can help offset this.
* Inherit on the MC. Even with the damage reduction, this skill is very viable on the MC due to the uniqueness of its mechanic.
* Increasing her Discipline to increase her Surety.

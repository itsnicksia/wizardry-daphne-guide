## Adventurer Reviews

??? info "TheAxolotl's Analysis"
    
    Alice is a fantastic unit to pull, and will likely be a staple in most folks' parties for a long while. Not only is she our first Legendary priest, but both of her skills are fantastic. Increasing her buff/debuff turn count by 1 means she gets an extra turn to heal, deal damage, or apply another buff/debuff before needing to reapply the initial. Furthermore, her damage increase to a row can apply to many af our strongest damage dealers.

    Changing her class to Mage will give her a wider selection of spells, as well, making her a very well-rounded Adventurer for support or damage purposes.

    To make things even better, many other characters will benefit from Alice duplicates. Inheriting her skill on your other favorite buffers/debuffers will allow them to each provide an extra turn for their buffs/debuffs!

    The turn duration increase from her Blessing of Agora skill adds one to the counter at rank three (on Alice, rank 5 on non-Alice), so it's possible to get at least a 5-turn duration on buffs and debuffs, which adds to the strength increasing her skill through inheritence.

    If you pull Alice, she will be a fantastic addition to your team!

## Duplicate Usage

* Inherit her skill on other buffers/debuffers you use. This is a great inherit for almost any adventurer, and extends the duration of most time-based abilities including Warrior's Battle Cry, Mental Unity, and even the Knight's three Cover skills.
* If you plan to use Alice, increasing her Discipline will increase her damage and healing.
* Save for future use.

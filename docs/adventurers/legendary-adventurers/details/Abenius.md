## Adventurer Reviews

!!! info "TheAxolotl's Analysis"

    Abenius has a few things going for her, but some things are unfortunately holding her back from being great. As far as positives, she's a Fighter, which automatically gives the highest Strength -> Attack Power conversion at the time of her release (1 STR = 1.2 Attack Power). Furthermore, she gains Attack Power with her Discipline levels, which is great.

    The passive damage boost from her Flickering Fang skill should be roughly 10%, which has the potential to be solid for her damage, particularly if we see more and more magical beasts as additional content gets released. The big difference bettween this and something like a damage boost to Entites or Undead is that the latter start out with innate resistance to physical weapons, while the former doesn't. In many cases, this could end up as a "kill harder" bonus where the damage boost is effectively wasted because you already would have done enough damage to the enemy. It'll definitely be more valuable against magical beast bosses, though.
    
    Her Flutterdream Flash skill is extremely unique and fun, but it's overall, quite limited. It's a "Minor physical attack" which means its damage will not compete with a Moderate attack like Gerulf's Eruption Strike or Gerard's Thunderstrike. In fact, the damage at skill level 1 is a bit over half of the damage dealt by a normal attack. In addition, it only activates one time per battle, targeting what appears to be the lowest-HP enemy. Abenius will always trigger this skill at the start of the battle unless the battle starts with an ambush, however when inherited to another adventurer, the activation rate and damage drops significantly (roughly 20% on the activation and damage is reduced to roughly 60% of a basic attack). To make this worse, skill inheritance increases the damage of the skill, as well as the amount of accuracy reduced, but it does not increase activation rate or the chance to trigger the accuracy reduction.

    One additional thing to note about Flutterdream Flash is that it can trigger the stun effect from maces and debuffs from things like the Dagger of Corrosion. This could provide some initial start-of-battle utility, albeit unreliably.

    Like Gerard, Abenius does not currently have a class change, and we don't know what it'll be when she gets one, assuming she will get one.

    Comparing her to Gerard, she has a better Attack Power modifier through her Fighter class, gains Attack Power with her Discipline, and she gains a fun mechanic, however her damage potential, particularly for whales with multiple skill inherits, is likely going to be lower than Gerard's due to Abenius needing to rely on a high skill level Heavy Strike as her active damage source.

## Duplicate Usage

* Increasing her Discipline to increase her Attack Power.
* Inherit on her own skill will increase the damage and accuracy reduction amount of her Flutterdream Flash.

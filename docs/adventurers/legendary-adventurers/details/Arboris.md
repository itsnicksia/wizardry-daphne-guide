## Adventurer Reviews

??? info "TheAxolotl's Analysis"

    Arboris is our very first limited legendary thief and he is, in my opinion, situationally useful at best.

    `Astral Break` is a major attack skill, which is great. It hits hard and provides a solid damage option for thieves. It's very costly SP-wise, at 20 SP for level 1, and being an elf, he already has a smaller SP pool than Debra, who is going to be his most common competitor. This skill is effectively an attack that simultaneously casts `PORTO` on himself and the adventurer in front of or behind him. At a glance, this seems pretty strong, but there are a few considerations. First, `PORTO` in itself is a conditional buff since it causes no impact on the turn it is used. When you're killing things fast, the `PORTO` portion of `Astral Break` will go to waste. For more extended fights, there's definitely value in it, but it's possible you could mess up your own turn order by getting `PORTO` simultaneously on one of the fastest adventurers in your party as well as presumably a slower one. Second, the fact that this buffs in a column means you have to pay extra close attention to your formation, as you'll want to position Arboris in front of someone that could gain value from the `PORTO` buff and have it actually impact the flow of a fight. Third, the `PORTO` portion is a buff, which makes it subject to the three buff limit, so if you use him, you'll want to keep that in mind.

    `Lord of the Deep Forest's`, outside of being grammatically weird, at a glance seems like solid evil and neutral support, however it also has some issues. First and foremost is that for the two skills being buffed, it is very hard to evaluate the effectiveness of the buffs. It is a Synergy that behaves similar to Rinne's Surety boost, always applying to him and extending to others that meet the criteria. Since it is a Synergy, that means we are unable to see the exact amount being modified, so it's a bit of a guess to know if it's even providing value. Initial testing currently seems to point to it being bugged and not doing anything, but we can't say for sure at this time. I'll update again when we know more. Assuming it is working, there are a few main scenarios I can think of where the action speed boost from `Lord of the Deep Forest's` may or may not be relevant.

    - You are perfectly speed-tuned to go ahead of most enemies you face and your buffers/debuffers always go before your damage dealers
        - In this scenario, gaining some passive action speed won't do much for you since it won't change your turn order and it won't make you outspeed enemies more than you're already outspeeding them
    - You have not spent much if any effort on speed tuning your party but you have made it so your party always goes before most enemies
        - In this scenario, the action speed could be nice, but you probably won't notice much of an impact since you aren't too worried about your party's turn order in general
    - You have speed tuned your party to go in the order you want but some of your party is still being outsped by enemies
        - In this scenario, you might see some benefit, as the action speed gains could be enough to finish getting your party going before the enemy, however it'll be variable based on the enemies you face. For example, vampires seem to have somewhere around 115 speed, and this synergy is very unlikely to be able to help you reach that.

    One potential consideration is that you could cut down on some of your ASPD blessings on certain adventurers because you know that they'd be getting the action speed from `Lord of the Deep Forest's` however that isn't something I'd really advise since we don't know the magnitude of the buff.

    I'm generally not a big fan of Discipline skills to begin with, so this will be short - in general, `King's Disposition` is absolute garbage as far as Discipline goes.

    Overall, having a conditional passive speed adjustment for a row and having access to a two-person `PORTO` could be situationally useful, but for most players, if you want to really mess with speed turning during a battle, using `BATILGREF` and `PORTO` will likely be both sufficient and a bit more consistent.

    I feel like people see something that I just don’t with this one. Let’s start with the good. Astral break is a Major tier damage skill that doesn’t require setup like Sneak Attack, and since thieves are unimpressive in fights, this seems like a way to alleviate that. The cost of 20SP is way too high and the ASPD buff is generally unimpactful and cumbersome when trying to maintain more relevant buffs against the 3 buff limit. As an inherit to others, they’re better off using other damaging skills. It being earth element is lame too.

    Evil wins again with his passive Evasion and ASPD buff. I thought Wizardy “evil” was supposed to mean more self-centered! On the flipside, this discipline focus is a joke! Accuracy and Stun Tolerance…what?

    In closing, he’s a thief alright. A skill he can only use a handful of times, anti-synergy between his race/class, one of the worst disciplines in the game and limited availability. There are better general adventurers than this. Mid.

## Adventurer Pull Plans

??? note "TheAxolotl's Pull Plan"
    Arboris was a pass for me. I personally felt the columnar PORTO was too situational for me to get a lot of value out of. I still managed to get a copy with a free bone, though. I don't know what I'll do with it, but he'll likely get inherited to someone in the future.

??? note "Lynd's Pull Plan"
    I pulled to get a single copy for collection reasons. If I didn't get him, I wouldn't have cared.

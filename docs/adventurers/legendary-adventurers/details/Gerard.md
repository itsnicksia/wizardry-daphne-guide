## Adventurer Reviews

!!! info "TheAxolotl's Analysis"

    I'll preface this with the fact that I did not pull on Gerard, so these are my thoughts on his kit as opposed to his performance. By all means, I welcome the analysis of someone who has him and has used him.

    At the time of release, Gerard is the biggest damage dealing Adventurer we have. His Thunderstrike skill is extremely potent, hitting for (I believe) harder than Gerulf's Eruption Strike, while also having the chance to paralyze your foes. If you're interested in having an Adventurer that deals damage, he is a great addition. One thing worth calling out is that he is a Dark unit, but he deals Wind damage with his skill, which is an interesting combination.

    Gerard also does not currently have a class change. We don't know why yet, but many speculate that his class change will be Ninja when that gets released.

    The thing that I personally don't like about Gerard is that outside of dealing damage, he doesn't really bring anything unique or interesting to a party. His job is to deal damage, and he does it well, but I personally like my Adventurers to provide utility and versatility, rather than being single-purpose.

    Don't let that stop you from pulling on him if you like him, though - when properly built, he can be a beast!

    * Pull if:
        * You like Gerard as an adventurer
    * Do not pull if:
        * You do not like Gerard as an adventurer
        * You want to save for future, more impactful adventurers
    
## Duplicate Usage

* Inherit on his own skill will increase the damage and cost of his Thunderstrike. This will result in more damage than increasing his Discipline will.
* If you've maxed out his Thunderstrike, increase his Discipline to increase his speed and evasion, which are both great skills to boost.

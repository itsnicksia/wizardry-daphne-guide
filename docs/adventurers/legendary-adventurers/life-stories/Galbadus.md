A ship glides into the harbor of a distant coastal frontier, its deck crowded with children-beastfolk slaves. As they are herded onto the docks, they keep their heads low, avoiding disdainful glares from the gathered onlookers. But among them, only Galba met each hateful look head-on, his sharp eyes glaring defiantly at the humans.  

Sold to that nation as a beastfolk slave, Galba was but ten years old. Even as a child, his powerful frame and agility allowed him to outmaneuver grown men, and consigned him into the battlefield as a slave soldier. Galba relished the battlefield. Obeying humans galled him, but nothing compared to the pleasure of crushing his enemies and seeing them driven before him.  

One day, during a clash with barbarians, Galba threw himself in the path of a crossbow bolt aimed at the king. His action was not driven by loyalty to the king. He only wanted to prevent his army's defeat. Nevertheless, the king was deeply moved by Galba's deed, and began to favor him greatly.

Having been saved by Galba, the king took him into his service as a retainer. He was granted unfettered access within the palace. Furthermore, he was given an education in culture and warfare, as well as in statecraft.  

Many warned that favoring a lowly beastfolk would diminish the king's authority, but he paid them no heed.  

One day, Galba posed a question to the king.  

"What makes a king?"  

"The one who rules the country and makes it prosper.  

Thus, a king must be the strongest and the wisest."  

Years passed, and Galba matured both as a beastfolk and as a knight. However, humans still shunned him-all save the king. Realizing that command of soldiers might prove a challenge for Galba, the king appointed him to his elite guard.  

That very night, Galba took the king's head. By the former king's own words: a king must be the strongest and the wisest. And so, Galba reasoned that he, a powerful beastfolk, was more deserving to sit upon the throne than a feeble human.

From the day he came to covet the throne, Galba had been gathering beastfolk allies in secret, amassing the strength he would need to seize the throne by force. At the very moment Galba beheaded his king, his fellow beastfolk sprang into action, striking the heart of the royal court. The fallen king's retainers and his young son were taken alive by the beastfolk and cast into the dungeons beneath the keep.  

Some among the beastfolk urged him to slay the royal family and their servants, but to Galba, the only enemy worth slaying was the former king. There was nothing to be gained from bloodshed. He kept the humans under his thumb, if only to keep the nation functioning. Galba then appointed his most skilled confederates to positions such as Knight Commander and Chancellor, ensuring the nation's core was held by beastfolk.  

The usurpation of the throne by the beastfolk army led by Galba quickly became known throughout the country. Some took up arms, refusing to submit to mongrels, but they were routed at every turn. Bit by bit, resistance waned, until there were none who stood against him. And so, Galba became king of the frontier nation.

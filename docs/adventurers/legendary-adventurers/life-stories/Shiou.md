A samurai wields their katana through discipline so grueling as to draw blood. Shiou has mastered Ephemeral Illusion style-a practical sword art suited to both one-on-one duels and combat against multiple opponents.

When she became enamored of the katana, she was still but a girl living in her beastfolk village enclave, secreted away in the East.

In the girl's ancestral home was displayed a treasured katana, an heirloom bestowed upon her forebear in recognition of military distinction. It was a blade of profound artistry. Each day, the girl gazed upon the graceful arc of its blade, her heart racing with fervent aspiration.

And the girl came to a sudden realization. A katana is meant for battle. It deserves more than to be a mere ornament. Drawing the blade from its scabbard, she flailed it around with reckless abandon. But something wasn't right... That much, she knew.

The girl longed to know how the katana must be wielded that it might truly come to life. It is said that there are samurai in the world who wield the katana as if it were an extension of their very will. Would meeting such a samurai not make that answer known to her? The girl's heart began to drift beyond the bounds of her village
enclave.

When she had grown to her full height, the girl embarked on a pilgrimage, katana in hand. In the East, there are many places that teach the art of the sword. She sought out the most renowned dojos, knocking upon each of their gates in turn, but there were none that would accept a beastfolk as a disciple.

Undeterred, the girl continued her journey, when one day the unmistakable ring of steel-on-steel came to her upturned ears. Propelled by an urgent wonder, she raced on, coming to a place where a lone samurai stood against countless brigands-he cut them down, one after another, all the while her eyes were glued to the brilliant gleam of his katana weaving through to battle.

The girl approached the samurai, Ouka, imploring that he take her on as a disciple. Ouka's gaze fell upon the katana the girl carried, carefully scrutinizing it. The katana bore an inscription indicating that it had been bestowed upon an ancestor in commendation.

"A samurai is one who is bound to their lord. You, a free-spirited beastfolk, can never be a true samurai. But you may yet come to know the way of the sword."

Her plea for tutelage was granted, with the understanding that she would join Ouka in battle at his behest, and she danced in jubilation. Her master's first teaching was thus: "If you would take up the katana, you must first still your heart."

Under the tutelage of her master, Ouka, the girl trained for many years. Katana poised-cut. And in those times the katana revealed its true beauty through her stroke, she felt the roar of a lion resonate deep within her.

And whenever her heart grew turbulent, she would close her eyes for three counts. As was her master's teaching. In the midst of battle, three seconds is fatally long. Should her heart falter when sparring, she inevitably met defeat at her master's hand. Thus, the girl never neglected her training to quiet her mind.

The technique of the Ephemeral Illusion style. And a spirit calm as still waters, like a polished mirror. Having perfected both, as well as the skill to deliver a singularly peerless strike, the girl's mastery was acknowledged and she was granted the name Shiou.

Shiou was given the role of gathering intelligence in various lands and dispatching messages to her master. To veil her role as a spy, she adopted the guise of a warrior on pilgrimage, along which, should she encounter anyone unworthy of holding a katana, she would vanquish them in a duel, claiming their blade in lieu of their life.

None could see through the guise of the beastfolk girl, who strode forth on her warrior's pilgrimage with joy alight in her eyes, in truth an agent of her lord.

Even as she fulfilled her duties gathering intelligence. Shiou came to be known across the land-for time and again she broke the dojos, collecting katanas in duels and leaving humbled warriors in her wake.

A katana is the very life of a samurai. Holding to that truth, its radiance grew ever more resplendent in her eyes. One must uphold a strength worthy of receiving a katana. This, Shiou resolved within her heart.

Yet, even as she mastered swordsmanship and learned to unveil the katana's beauty with her own hands, she still felt a lingering inadequacy within herself.

Amidst all this came a letter-a missive from Ouka ordering her to battle. She had no intention of breaking her oath to respond to her master's request in times of war. However, the territory governed by her master's lord should not now be embroiled in war.

With foreboding in her heart, Shiou raced forth, arriving in time only to see Ouka mercilessly cutting down the people of his own lands. Her master, drenched from head to toe in the blood of the people, leveled his katana at Shiou.

Ouka uttered not a word. Yet, for a count of three, his eyes closed. The heart of her master was faltering. Never before had she beheld such a moment.

She did not know what was going on. But she knew that she must strike him down-that it had to be stopped. Her katana was in her hands-and in that instant, Shiou surpassed her master.

"Our lord has gone mad. Consumed by suspicion, he bade me slay his own people... My lord's command is not to be defied. But I could not bring myself to slay those without fault. Shiou, you have done well..."

With these parting words, her master passed, a faint smile lingering on his remains.

Loyalty was a thing beyond Shiou's understanding. Yet though her master's heart had wavered, the blade he wielded remained unerringly beautiful. It was then that Shiou knew there was a beauty born only from those who carry the weight of duty.
Bearing Ouka's sword upon her back, Shiou made her way alone into the stronghold. From that moment, the lord's madness came to an abrupt halt. Yet there are none who know what transpired between the lord and Shiou.

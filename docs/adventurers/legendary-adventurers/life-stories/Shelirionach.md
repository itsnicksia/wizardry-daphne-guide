In an elven settlement to the extreme north, lived a 'witch' who could control fate itself. Whosoever treads upon the forbidden lands of the far north shall be cursed and tall to ruin. Even now, so the tale is told.

In that settlement stood a Sacred Tree, most ancient, which, from time to time, granted the power for foresight to a young village girl. The girl, endowed with the ability to glimpse fate, was then to undergo training in spellcraft, that she not be overcome by the Sacred Tree's power.

The power to foretell fate wanes with age and, upon reaching adulthood, it is lost completely. However, she becomes a witch of terrifying magical power.

Shelirionach was born in such a village, one of the girls conferred the Sacred Tree's blessing.

To her fortune or misfortune...Shelirionach's particular affinity with the Sacred Tree granted her immense magical power and an uncommon power to gaze into the future.

In comparison to other witches, Shelirionach saw what was to come more clearly, in more vivid detail. So much so that lords of distant lands came calling after her by name, having heard rumors. Her renown spread further and further.

This kept SHelirionach extremely busy.

Due to her connection with the Sacred Tree, Shelirionach was in perpetually poor health. A constant lethargy, mind-dulling migraines... However she complained of poorly she fared, her work did not lessen.

Though Shelirionach longed to escape her duties,, she knew all too clearly what future awaited if she dared to neglect her responsibilities.

It was one thing to b upbraided by kin, but at times she saw a future in which she incurred the wrath of a tyrant, leading to the strife of war.

And so, however much she loathed it, she carried out her duties in solemn obedience.

As Shelirionach grew older, she yearned for the swift loss of her power to cast her gaze upon fate. If only she could no longer see fate, she would be free.

She endured each day by fantasizing what she would be like, once free.

Alas, despite such hopes, the power of foretelling showed no sign of weakening, no sign of going away, and the days of this girl loved by the Sacred Tree continued on, unaltered.

Unfortunately, the hardworking Shelirionach's fame only grew, leading to even more work. And as a result...her troubles only mounted.

Far from the elven village was a barbaric land. Its infamous, bloodthirsty barbarian king had taken an interest in Shelirionach.

This savage monarch bade her come to his land.

At the arrival of the barbarian king's missive, the village is thrown into an uproar. A witch who gazes upon fate was never to pass beyond the village gates. The elven villagers were outraged at the affront of a summons to that which was to be worshipped.

With an even more somber expression, Shelirionach gave her counsel.
"I will go... That king is despotic. Refuse him and this village will be put to the sword, burned..."

The villagers fell silent at Shelirionach's words. And so, having written of their acceptance to the barbarian king, solemnly, and begrudgingly, Shelirionach made her way to barbarian lands.

Shelirionach was brought before the hulking king in a dust-choked palace. The barbarian king asked her what his future held for him.

As she had always done, Shelirionach cast her gaze into the future. Poised to pronounce that future... She paused, mouth closing.

Shelirionach had gazed upon the doom of the barbarian kingdom. And that, in the telling of it, she'd earn the king's ire and be put to death, though the king had averted that doom. And also how he would go on to ravage many more kingdoms, leaving destruction in his wake. Because she had gazed so clearly into that far-flung future.

So she lied. Words carefully chosen to please the king, she made her proclamation, speaking so as to ensure the barbarian kingdom's path to destruction.

Hearing this, the king was overjoyed. Shelirionach and her retinue were released, returning to their elven village without harm.

In time, a terrible plague descended upon the barbarian kingdom. For it had been carried in on pestilent corpses borned by those who sought vengeance. The barbarian king and his subordinates, having expanded their domain through conquest, lacked any resistance and soon perished.

It is said that people came to fear the Doomsayer Witch, the witch of the far north, who, they whispered, brought ruin upon the barbarian kingdom in her fury over the disrespect of the barbarian king's summons.

Nestled in a lush, mountainous valley lies a settlement called Ironwood. Deep within the surrounding forest dwelt terrifying monsters, the mountain terror, direbears.

The dwarves of Ironwood hunt them relentlessly, keeping their threat from spilling into the wider lands and earning the respect of neighboring races as steadfast guardians.

Yrsa was born into a family of Ironwood's most skilled hunters. Her father held the vital role of observing prey during group hunts and conveying their movements to the chief, who would direct the hunt. From her earliest days, Yrsa accompanied him through rugged forests and craggy slopes, learning the rhythms of nature, monitoring the movements of monsters, and gradually sharpening the subtle skill of interpreting every piece of information she gathered.

Yrsa had never been comfortable with conversation, and never opened up with anyone in the village. When she wasn't roaming the mountain paths, she delved deeply into books and carefully recorded the workings of the natural world. Among the dwarves, who prized fellowship above all else, she remained markedly out of step.

However, when it came to her keen eye for observation and her talent with a bow, no other youth could surpass her.

direbears into a savage frenzy, they came stalking after humans. As autumn settled in, the dwarves busied themselves with the yearly task of readying their weapons and armor. Alongside them, Yrsa too prepared for the direbears, crafting arrows by the armload.

It was that winter when Yrsa's father was taken from her by the direbear.

It happened during the hunt, while everyone was closing in on a direbear that had wandered too near the Ironwood. From their flank, an especially massive direbear lunged through the lines, battering nearby dwarves clean off their feet. And then, with a brutal snap of its jaws, it latched onto her father and dragged him off into the wilds. Yrsa tried to give chase, but the shock left her legs trembling so violently she couldn't force them to carry her forward. The dwarves caught in the direbear's strike were slain outright, dropping where they stood.

Whether her father was alive or dead was uncertain. Yrsa insisted that she would go out and save her father, but the clanlord of the Ironwood only shook his head. Even so, Yrsa would not back down. In the Ironwood, there was a long-held belief that the soul of anyone taken by the mountain was not to return, never to be born again among dwarfkin.

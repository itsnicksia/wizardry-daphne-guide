Nestled in a lush, mountainous valley lies a settlement called Ironwood. Deep within the surrounding forest dwelt terrifying monsters, the mountain terror, direbears.

The dwarves of Ironwood hunt them relentlessly, keeping their threat from spilling into the wider lands and earning the respect of neighboring races as steadfast guardians.

Yrsa was born into a family of Ironwood's most skilled hunters. Her father held the vital role of observing prey during group hunts and conveying their movements to the chief, who would direct the hunt. From her earliest days, Yrsa accompanied him through rugged forests and craggy slopes, learning the rhythms of nature, monitoring the movements of monsters, and gradually sharpening the subtle skill of interpreting every piece of information she gathered.

Yrsa had never been comfortable with conversation, and never opened up with anyone in the village. When she wasn't roaming the mountain paths, she delved deeply into books and carefully recorded the workings of the natural world. Among the dwarves, who prized fellowship above all else, she remained markedly out of step.

However, when it came to her keen eye for observation and her talent with a bow, no other youth could surpass her.

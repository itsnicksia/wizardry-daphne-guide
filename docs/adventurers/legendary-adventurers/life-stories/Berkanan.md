It was an ancient itme, before it was even certain what name the continent even went by... There was another continent far away from there.

A magical hole suddenly appeared in the continent, filled to the brim with monsters and treasure, as well as traps. Berkanan was a fledgling adventurer taking on the dungeon. Her hometown was in a foreign land beyond the sands to the east. The reason she came all the way from there was to make a name for herself in the dungeon and become a great mage.

If her fellow countrymen heard this, they would probably scoff at Berkanan's recklessness. From an early age, she was inferior in every aspect compared to those around her. Slow Berka. Blundering Berka. Useless Berka. That is what they kept telling her. But she is no longer willing to just take the abuse. The girl worked up her courage and took a step toward adventure.

Berkanan had been taught the ultimate technique of flame, HALITO, by her grandmother. It was soon after she set out to find companions for her adventure that she learned that it was only a basic spell in the dungeon. Apparently, adventurers had no use for a mage who could only toss fire around.

Nevertheless, the girl did not give up and continuing her search for companions, she joined a party that had lost their mage. Even if she was being added to the party solely to fill a gap, she was still satisfied.

Berkanan and her party progressed through the dungeon. And then they encountered it. The massive, the mighty...red...dragon. The dragon's fiery breath assailed the adventurers. In an instant, Berkanan's screams and her life were engulfed in flame.

Eventually, Berkanan heard a voice in the distance. Murmur-Chant-Pray-Invoke.

"HOt! It's hot?! Aughahhhh?! Ahhhhhh!!!"

Berkanan woke with a scream. Burned to death by dragon fire, she was resurrected and brought back to the world. But it was not the companions who had gone into the dungeon with her that had requested her resurrection. It was an unknown boy and girl. The boy explained that they had just happened to find her. And then he asked Berkanan: what are you going to do now?

Memories whirled around in Berkanan's head. She couldn't do anything well. Things always turned out terribly for her. Would things also be like that from now on? Would she keep on running away, always, always, always afraid? I'd hate that, she thought. No, she didn't want it at all. With her eyes no doubt set on the future, Berkanan said, "I want...to take down that red dragon."

The boy and girl who resurrected Berkanan were accompanied by an adventurer named Iarumas. The probable leader of the trio, Iarumas, said to Berkanan that they would slay the red dragon.

"I don't mind. That's more than enough reason to go on an adventure."

And so Berkanan joined their party. From the on, she devoted her days to training as a fighter and searching for the Dragon Slayer, a weapon that could kill a dragon. Berkanan was completely absorbed. But she did not give up, however much she whined about the threats of the dungeon.

And so, after much searching, Berkanan obtained the Dragon Slayer. She couldn't tell if she was any stronger than before. But...she had moved forward. Berkanan could feel it.

Dragon Slayer in hand, Berkanan, along with Iarumas and the others, prepared to counterattack. And so, the fledgling adventurer girl finally faced the red dragon again. As the beast raised its head to look at her, in the face of that overwhelming presence, the girl roared.

"Y-Y...Y-You...may not...remember me, but...!"
"I haven't forgotten you!"

Thus, the battle began.

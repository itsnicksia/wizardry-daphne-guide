In the western frontier, along the shore of a beautiful lake, there was a place called the Mirror-Mere Village. Livana was brought into this world a member of the family of guardians who protected that village.

Though the village held an abundant source of water, it had never been invaded by anyone. This was by virtue of the family's inherent tolerance to spellcraft and the Mirror-Mere's enhancement of that power.

However, the mirror only responds to a heart that's pure and righteous. And so, the guardians were committed to justice and seeking justice.

Young Livana, full of pride in the House of her birth, honed her skills as a fighter to become a full-fledged guardian.

"One day, I will be head of the House!"
Everyone around her loved her and the cockiness with which she would say such things.

Without wallowing in her talent, Livana continued her training, and before she knew it, she had become the most skilled in the village. Whenever invaders came for the village's water source, there she stood at the forefront of battle, easily routing them.

Everyone recognized Livana as a candidate for leader. And so, a test was set before her.

It was for the ceremonial implement necessary in the ritual to become a full-fledged guardian--
To obtain the Mirror-Mere, she was to set off on a journey from the village. Her destination was a sacred mountain in the east. By carving and polishing one of the special stones found there, she was to obtain a Mirror-Mere of her very own.

On the day of her departure, the leader quieted his rowdy students and said to her calmly, "what is justice? Go and find your answer."
In doing so, the Mirror-Mere would surely acknowledge Livana.

With the leader's words in her heart, Livana sallied forth, into the world outside. Into a hitherto unknown world, to meet her justice.

Setting out for the sacred mountain to the east, Livana met many people along the way. The poor, the oppressed... To protect them, Livana sometimes fought monsters, and sometimes fought against corrupt lords who only exploited their people.

Though she was the village's greatest protector, she was occasionally pressed into pitched battles. Even when she was on the verge of breaking, there were moments when she was given courage by children, smaller and weaker than herself.

On the other hand, allies she met along her travels would sometimes point out her immaturity and offer her guidance.

This long journey taught Livana, who had grown up surrounded by love in the village, the vastness and harshness of the world.

Saving many people as she continued her travel, Livana finally reached the sacred mountain in the east.

Having acquired a Mirror-Mere for the ritual, Livana finally returned to her home village. However, what greeted her was the charred remains of her village and her people. The invaders, seeking to seize the water source, had grown frustrated by the guardians protecting the village and had prepared a secret weapon. They had hired a cabal of mages who had made a demonic pact, and attacked the village with an unprecedented force.

Seeing Livana, the mage cabal immediately unleashed their spells upon her. They were spells to rob her of control over her body. However many times she fought them off, she was subjected to their incessant spells and gradually driven into a corner. This was how the invaders, with overwhelming numbers, had cornered and slain the village's guardians. The leader of the invaders said to Livana, "if you agree to use the Water Mirror for our sake, we will spare your life." There was no way Livana would accept such a bargain. In desperation, she hastened to the shrine where the rite of succession was performed, that she might realize her own justice, discovered in her travels.

"What is justice? Ga and find your answer."
Recalling the words of her leader on the day of her departure, Livana let out a fierce cry from the depths of the srhine.
--Her justice was to defend those who desired serenity.
"I tolerate no wanton plundering or violence! So I will be the one to put an end to people like you!"

The spells cast by the mages came at Livana like a raging storm. But the Mirror-Mere, answering the resolve in her heart, flared with a fierce light, dispelling the countless spells and sweeping away her enemies.

She had avenged them. But neither her village nor her house would ever return. Clutching the Mirror-Mere to her breast, Livana set out on her journey once again. She sought to smite evil with her own strength and justice, defending the people.

"Such is the duty of the family who loved justice...my duty as the one who survived."
That she might erase even one sorrow from the world, she continued her fight, and her tale passed on through future generations.

And thus she came to be known as the Mage-Slaying White Daemon... Repelling magic with the power of justice.

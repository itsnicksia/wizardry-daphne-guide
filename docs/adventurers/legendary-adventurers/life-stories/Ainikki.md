It was an ancient time, before it was even certain what name the continent even went by... There was another continent far away from there.  

A magical hole suddenly appeared in the continent, filled to the brim with monsters and treasure, as well as traps. Day after day, countless adventurers brave the dungeon, only to be destroyed. And it was a common thing for corpses to be hauled off to the temple.  

Murmur-Chant-Pray-Invoke.  

Sister Ainikki's words filled the tranquil chapel. Those who have lived a good life do not return to life, for God has deemed their life of value. If one wishes to delay death, one must show God the potential for an even better life-that is, one must offer a larger tithe.  

There are those who deride Ainikki for hypocritical cant for speaking so. But she believed it. The higher price for their resurrection meant that God had recognized the worth of their life.

Ainikki-Aine showed mercy without distinction, requested tithes, and performed resurrections. She often came face to face with larumas, the corpse-hauler who retrieved adventurers' bodies from the dungeon and brought them to the temple. It was also common for her to give larumas a sermon whenever he came by.  

"I haven't forgotten! You haven't been able to show God your value yet, Iarumas-sama!"  

Iarumas had been retrieved from the dungeon and resurrected at the temple where Aine served. He was resurrected because God had recognized the greater value of his life.  

"As such, you must show God that you can live a better life!"  

Aine prayed for Iarumas's safety before sending him on his way. Wishing that all adventurers, and all living people, could live a life in line with the wishes of the God that would let them die.

Beautiful eyes. A slender frame. At times, a demeanor that seemed almost childlike. With her delicate figure and the position she held as a temple cleric, Aine, as one might expect, served in the rear as a priest. And yet-  

"Hahhhh...! Yahhhh!!!"  

When assailants descended upon Iarumas' party in the heart of the town, the inexperienced young adventurers quickly found themselves in grave danger. Aine took up her greatsword and the attacker's head flew off.  

"May you have a good death under the protection of God..."  

The beautiful elven girl remained unconcerned by the blood splattered across her, and, as usual, began sermonizing to Iarumas. The strength and valor with which she swung her weapon without hesitation were also part of who Sister Ainikki was.

Iarumas met his death many times in the dungeon, and when he was brought to the temple, Aine resurrected him. Even stripping him of everything he had wasn't enough to cover the cost of resurrection, so Iarumas's debt grew even further.  

The cost of resurrection was proof that God had recognized the value of his life. Aine, who believed in God from the bottom of her heart, would go without collecting a tithe. That being the case-who was it that covered the cost when Iarumas was first resurrected, discovered in uncharted depths of the dungeon with no companions from his past life?  

Sister Aine smiled and answered, "It was me, you know?"  

"I was a little...curious. For some reason... What were you born to do? And what did you die trying to accomplish?"  

Aine guides Iarumas until the day he proves to God the value of a better life and is welcomed into the City of God.

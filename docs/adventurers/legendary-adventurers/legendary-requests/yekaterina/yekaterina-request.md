# Unnamed Request

## Request Requirements

* Yekaterina must be on the party
* Certain Trust Level must be achieved with Yekaterina.

Once the requirements are met, the "request" will be available IN THE TAVERN at the Adventurer's Guild at the Royal Capital Lukmalia. 

!!! warning Important Notice
    This "request" can only be finished **once** per character copy. If you missed something, you
    won't be able to go back for it. So don't rush it!

## Request Mission

Request has you go to the Tavern which triggers a conversation about Yekaterina wanting to retrieve some bone parts for Doctor from her late husband, Dean. The dungeon consists of many long paths with specific rooms that you will need to go into to find her husband. However, there are many rooms that are not her husband's and all of them contain a boss fight versus various undead, typically having one or more skeleton giant and various other skeletons. The enemies will scale to your team's grade. Upon finding her husband's grave, the "request" is essentially completed and you get some backstory.

### Notes:
- All enemies are undead.
- The enemies are quite tanky.
- You only need to go to her husband's grave. It is the room marked with a medicinal plant, and is around the top middle of the map.

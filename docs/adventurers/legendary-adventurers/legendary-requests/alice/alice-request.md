# Preparation of an Offering to My God

!!! bug "Doing this request with a merged Alice will result in her inherit skill getting bugged (forced back to level 1) upon changing to her original form and back after completing the request"

## Request Requirements

* Alice must in the party
* Certain Trust Level must be achieved with Alice.
* You must have the normal Alice and not Snow-Sleeved Maiden Alice.

Once the requirements are met, the "request" will be available upon entering the Royal Capital and watching the cutscene with Alice. If you don't immediately get this cutscene, you can also try going into the tavern to activate the request.

!!! warning "Important Notice"
    This "request" can only be finished **once** per character copy. If you missed something, you won't be able to go back for it. So don't rush it!

## Request Mission

!!! danger "There are two different endings to this request, that of which permanently change Alice. Please make sure which form you would prefer before committing."

1. Alice will tell you about how she feels like Agora's presence is waning and would like to see what's going on. You will need to slaughter 3 Gorgons in the Valeon Grasslands in order to summon Agora. There will be a Gorgon near the entrance (indicated by a bear shaped mob) that you can kill, leave, and then return to do this part quickly.
2. After killing three Gorgons, you can head to the Royal Capital ruins and watch the cutscene where Agora tells you about how Alice is too strong and is essentially erasing its existence. You will need to head to Agora's shrine to find out more.
3. Head to the shrine via the world map. The door directly south to Agora's shrine is locked, and you will need to light 4 fires in the 4 corners of the map AS WELL AS leaving a unit of your party at that fire to protect it. The fires are all behind a door and will require fighting a few undead to light the fire. Interact with the fire once lit to select an adventurer to leave at the fire, as if you leave the room without doing so, the fire will be blown out and you will need to re-light and fight the undead again.
4. Once all 4 fires are lit, head to the southmost middle room and fight a Necrocore with only your MC and Alice. The Necrocore just casts Zelos in its first phase and is relatively weak. However, once it enters its 2nd phase, it will self buff with 4 turns of 3 buffs, most important of which is the defense buff which makes it immune to damage. This defense buff is also the last to be dispelled. During this time he will cast a column skill that can be avoided by shifting the positions of the MC/Alice to any other columns from which they originally were in. After the defense buff is dispelled or naturally falls off, the Necrocore will die to the next hit.
5. At this point Agora will appear again and ask you to kill Alice so that it may take over her body entirely. When Alice regains consciousness, you are given 4 options. The second option will automatically spare her, as she will take it as a joke and inadvertently vaporize Agora. The other options give you dialogue choices to either spare or kill her.
6. If Alice is chosen to survive, her Inherit skill will have an added bonus of MP and Piety per level, while if Agora is chosen to survive, the Inherit skill will instead have MP and I.Q.

You can get new Adventurers by reversing Adventurer and Legendary Bones, acquired from chests, daily rewards, Jeweler purchases, missions and the Mausoleum. How do I get the Featured Adventurer? You can get a Featured Adventurer by reversing their bones, purchased from the Jeweler. You will need 100 Reversals for enough tokens to exchange directly for the Featured Adventurer. How many Gems to guarantee the Featured Legendary Adventurer? 18,200 Gems if you're buying 11 Featured Bones for 2000 Gems each time. This will give you 100 Tokens to purchase the Featured Adventurer from the Exchange. Which Bones should I buy? Featured Legendary Bones. Buying <code>Adventurer's Remains</code> is not recommended. When should I use <code>Adventurer Bones</code> and <code>Legendary Bones</code>? Up to you. You can use them to strengthen your party with new adventurers, Discipline, and Skill Inheritance, or save for when new Adventurers are added to the pool. What should I get with Guild Points? Gems and Adventurer's Bones. Do Tokens carry over to other banners? No. What is the difference between Gems of Org (Green) and Gems of Erin (Purple)? Purple Gems can only be obtained with real money, and are used to purchase Purple Legendary Bones and daily Skill Books. Green Gems can be obtained from daily rewards, purchases, and missions. Why does the Featured Legendary Adventurer have two banners? One banner uses Purple Legendary Bones which awards additional Featured Equipment when pulling the Featured Adventurer. Is Featured Equipment worth it? Not really. The random quality and grade make it risky. There are rare exceptions, such as the 3-hit Cuisinart Sword. What should I spend my Gems on? Legendary Adventurer Bones and Class Change scrolls. Which purchases have the best value? Experience and Class Remains packages have the most Gems per dollar. See Purchase Evaluation page for more information. Is there a Pity System? No. Is there a Spark System? Yes. Each pull on a Featured Adventurer Banner gives a token which can be used exchanged for the Featured Adventurer (100 Tokens), Featured Equipment, Skill Books, and other items. Will Featured Adventurers be added to the Permanent Banner? Drecom has announced that they will, but none have been added as of March 2025."},{"location":"frequently-asked-questions/#adventurers","title":"Adventurers","text":"Question Answer I got two copies of an adventurer and they have different stats.

This means not every spawn point for a particular request you encounter matches the spawn point someone else encounters. From what we can tell, every floor has a defined number of possible layouts that get loaded in for a player.

At the time of writing this, Merging is only available to Lanavaille, Flut, and Adam. When you merge the two styles, you get a single adventurer that has the option to swap styles. In addition, that adventurer gets a new passive skill called <code>Contiguous States of Mind</code> that results in a minor 1 point increase to a few stats.</p> <p>When a unit is merged, there are some things that carry over and some things that do not. All inherited skills learned by one style are shared with the other style, so you do not lose any skill inherits by swapping styles. For example, if your Standard Lanavaille has <code>Queen of War and Love</code> at level 3, and Wandering Princess Lanavaille has <code>Queen of War and Love</code> at level 1, the merged adventurer will retain the level 3 version. I do not know what happens if you merge an adventurer that has a level 3 version of the skill with an adventurer that has a level 2 version of the skill. I suspect the higher value would override the lower value instead of adding them together, but I have not confirmed this.</p> <p>Each style, however, has its own Discipline skill and non-inheritable Unique skill. Any Discipline levels that have been given to one style do not carry over to the other style. For example, if you have Standard Lanavaille at Discipline 3, then you switch to Wandering Princess Lanavaille at Discipline 1, the Standard Lanavaille Discipline 3 skills are not also given to Wandering Princess Lanavaille.</p> <p>According to in-game text, the merged adventurer retains all trait points and the current class of the version used as base. For example, if you have a Wandering Princess Lana with 5 bonus points and an IV in Luck and a standard Lana with 8 bonus points and an IV in Vitality, merging Wandering Princess into Standard will result in the final Lana having 8 bonus points and an IV in Vitality, while merging Standard into Wandering Princess will result in the final Lana having 5 bonus points and an IV in Luck.</p> <p>Similarly, if you have a Fighter Lana and a Knight Wandering Princess Lana, the final class will be the class currently associated with the one used as base, however you will retain access to both classes.</p> <p>Ultimately, there is no reason not to merge an adventurer when you have the opportunity, regardless of who the adventurer is. You'll have to make a decision at that point which style you prefer to use. A minor stat gain with either style is better than no stat gain with neither style.</p>"},{"location":"frequently-asked-questions/#what-are-character-duplicates-used-for","title":"What are character duplicates used for?","text":"<p>They can be used to:</p> <ol> <li>Increase a character's Discipline level</li> <li>Increase a character's unique skill level </li> <li>Inherit a character's inheritable unique skill to another character (or your MC) </li> <li>Dismiss for Grade Tags While dismissing a Legendary character seems scary, it's possible that for some characters, that will be the absolute best value of their duplicates due to the fact that dismissing a level 1 Legendary character that has not completed a grade-up exam will give you 1 No Grade Tag and 1 Iron Grade Tag.

Two variations of the maps with tile changes are included below, but your maps and the location of certain events may not perfectly match what is shown. Key events on variable tiles do always occur in the same rooms on those tiles, so look for similar features. </p> B1F -Pit- <p>Note</p> <p>Not much to say, first floor, welcome. Look for the Beginning Abyss Key for a nice surprise on floor 2. On second playthrough, make sure to talk to Chris to unlock a bondmate quest. He's the elf on the left side dead end when you first enter.</p> Variation 1Variation 2 <p> </p> <p> </p> B2F -Temple- <p>Note</p> <p>You will fight your real first boss here. Not much to say, use the harken afterwards. Only important thing of note is the room to the right has an infinite respawn mob that you can grind on early levels. If you found the key on B1F, the locked room on the left will have a few adventurer bones to help you build your team (one time only).</p> <p></p> B3F -Cave-In Zone- <p>Note</p> <p>You can continue your way through until the story makes you examine the rocks. Examine all surrounding surfaces enough times and you can reverse the rocks and proceed. Make sure you reverse all rocks and find the cause of death of your friends for important knowledge. There's a camp where it restores all your hp/mp/sp. It can be used once each time you enter the labyrinth. The Goblin's nest is not worth doing, leave it.</p> Variation 1Variation 2 <p></p> <p></p> B4F -Labyrinth <p>Note</p> <p>First time here? You get to watch your friends die. Second time here? Fix it with the wheel! This is the first time the game shows you raising a stone will lower and raise certain paths, that's really it. Oh, watch out for the rabbits. They've got a vicious streak a mile wide.</p> Variation 1Variation 2 <p> </p> <p></p> B5F -Warped One's Nest- <p>Note</p> <p>The top left side will be a warped one's nest in the beginning of the map, I don't suggest going there unless you're prepared, not much there. The larger rectangular area will have a boss for you. Prepare accordingly. Also, check this map to avoid the poison tile paths.</p> <p></p> B6F -Map Killer- <p>Note</p> <p>Don't bother opening the wrong door where the corpse tells you. It's just spikes. The corpses will give you hints to get through the level. I believe the correct warp order is right, up, then right or left depending on the previous corpse warning. (The light/sun rises in the east and sets in the west.) Statue room puzzle requires you to restore the statue heads that match your party members according to the clue on the nearby dead body. If none match, leave all heads broken. This clue can change every time you enter this level. See answers in the FAQ. Saint shield quest is also completed here; do the second warp wrong and fight the mob.</p> Variation 1Variation 2 <p></p> <p></p> B7F -Amongst the Dead- <p>Note</p> <p>You will need to go through the poison floors every time UNLESS you reverse the stones on the next floor that create shortcuts. Make sure to do that. B8F description tells you which stones open which paths.  Albano will REALLY not like you here, unless YOU DO something correctly (second playthrough only). The camp here is important as you can't access the Harken on the next floor until you beat the final boss. </p> Variation 1Variation 2 <p></p> <p></p> B8F -Deepest Depths- <p>Note</p> <p>The four stones on this floor can be reversed to create new paths on B7F.  From the entry stairs, the closest two stones creates paths on B7F at X:21,Y:11 and X:12,Y:2 to reach the unreachable treasure chests. The third stone connects the entry room to the hallway with the Camp by adding a path on B7F at X:8,Y:14.  The fourth stone connects the hallway with the Camp to the hallway with the stairs down to floor 8 by adding a path on B7F at X:14,Y:15.  No, you must kill the boss to reach the harken. Yes, there are mimics now. They hurt, but good news, defending their p atk gives you a big opening for massive damage. Good luck on the boss, and hope your head won't fly. (It will if this will be your first playthrough.)</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"abyss-guides/1-beginning-abyss/requests/","title":"Requests","text":""},{"location":"abyss-guides/1-beginning-abyss/requests/#the-beginning-abyss-requests","title":"The Beginning Abyss - Requests","text":""},{"location":"abyss-guides/1-beginning-abyss/requests/#fresh-start","title":"Fresh Start","text":""},{"location":"abyss-guides/1-beginning-abyss/requests/#sweet-walnut-delivery","title":"Sweet Walnut Delivery","text":"Request <ul> <li>Talk to the Smirking Adventurer in the tavern  </li> <li>Go to Beginning Abyss -Entrance- and gather the Walnuts</li> </ul> Location"},{"location":"abyss-guides/1-beginning-abyss/requests/#light-shield-material-collection","title":"Light Shield Material Collection","text":"Request <ul> <li>Go to B1 of Beginning Abyss</li> </ul> Location"},{"location":"abyss-guides/1-beginning-abyss/requests/#fragrant-plant-seed-delivery","title":"Fragrant Plant Seed Delivery","text":"Request <ul> <li>Go to Inn  </li> <li>Go to B1 and find the herbs</li> </ul> Location <p>Note</p> <p>It's possible this is randomly in any small room</p>"},{"location":"abyss-guides/1-beginning-abyss/requests/#scrap-sabaton-collection","title":"Scrap Sabaton Collection","text":"Request <ul> <li>Go to the Item shop to activate the request  </li> <li>Go to the guild and accept the quest  </li> <li>In B1 gather junk and turn in the request  </li> <li>Go back to the item shop to receive item</li> </ul>"},{"location":"abyss-guides/1-beginning-abyss/requests/#rhodium-delivery","title":"Rhodium Delivery","text":"Request <ul> <li>Go to the blacksmith to activate this quest  </li> <li>Go to the guild and accept the request   </li> <li>Continue on until B6F then collect the 2 Rhodium  </li> <li>Turn in the request  </li> <li>Go back to the blacksmith</li> </ul> Locations Info <p>Follow Green for one and Blue for the other</p>"},{"location":"abyss-guides/1-beginning-abyss/requests/#minor-harken-unlocked","title":"Minor Harken Unlocked","text":""},{"location":"abyss-guides/1-beginning-abyss/requests/#death-stench-investigation","title":"Death Stench Investigation","text":"Request <ul> <li>Go to B1F and defeat the Ambush</li> </ul> Location <p>To reset this request for the monthly bone, you'll need to walk to the B1F harken from the Cursed Wheel point Fresh Start, otherwise it will not respawn.

Note that if you are trying to get the IQ Guiding Light, you\u2019ll need to fight Melgina (not Octonarus) a second time anyway, so I personally took the first option because it made sense to me to just collect the mermaid statue knowledge as I went through the maps again.

Many monsters are also \"Magical Beasts\", so characters or weapons with the \"Magical Beast-Slayer\" trait would also be useful.</li> <li>Iron/Steel level gear are commonplace drops in this Abyss, so it's recommended to begin building some in preparation for the next Abyss.</li> <li>Do not sell all of your Sahuagin Scales when obtaining them as you begin this Abyss, as they are needed for a mandatory main story request.  You will need 5 each time you complete that request, and you'll have to go back to find more if you've sold them all.</li> </ul> <p>Note: There are areas where you are carried by a strong current. You must unlock the ability to reverse the water statues. Some have a timer to become cursed again. Some areas will be completely submerged. You should lure monsters out of the water in these areas or they`ll be stronger</p> 1st District - Back Alley <p></p> About this floor <ul> <li>There are some locked doors here.  The key will become available to you later in the story and you can come back to collect any chests behind the doors.</li> </ul> 2nd District - Black Market <p></p> About this floor <ul> <li>The mermaid statue on this and subsequent floors give important lore both contextually and are significant for being able to fight Octonarus. Make sure to get their knowledge.</li> </ul> 3rd District - Iron Gate Street <p></p> About this floor <ul> <li>Your first scripted battle is on this floor against a Lizard Commander, at the end of the floor.  This is a strong enemy with a lot of armor.  The best strategy is to block and create openings if your team is undergeared and/or underleveled.</li> </ul> 4th District - Boulevard <p>Note</p> <p>When you\u2019re locked in the room and drowning, you need to attempt to leave the area through both the upper left and upper right sections of the room you\u2019re in, as well as attempt to go back into the current before you\u2019re able to activate the statue to drain the water. Heal with items as needed and take as few steps as possible!  (Some people have reported -version 1.13.0 and later- being unable to progress unless you first try to 'use' the statue, then try and fail to leave on all three paths out, then try one more time to 'use' the statue.)</p> <p></p> 5th District - Sunken City <p></p> About this floor <p>There are quite a lot of flooded rooms in this floor. You cannot cast magic while underwater, so it's recommended to carry scrolls on spell users. Aquatic enemies like Sahuagin gain significant action speed and evasion while underwater. If possible, try to lure fights out of the water.</p> 6th District - Warehouse <p></p> About this floor <p>There is another scripted battle on this floor against an Oar Collector. It is advised to turn off the northwest most dragon statue via the north path before fighting the Oar Collector as it will grant 3 turns of unsubmerged combat before the water levels rise again.</p> 7th District - Pier <p></p> About this floor <p>There are no enemies on this floor, though there are things to find if you look around hard enough.</p> Seaside of the Dead <p></p> About this floor <p>There are no enemies on this floor, though you can fight the Sahuagin for the object it picked up if you accepted the small quest from the woman above.</p> Lower Deck 1 -Ship's Hold- <p></p> About this floor <p>There are a lot of enemy spawns on this floor, and no real way to avoid them as there are narrow corridors. This is also where you find the NPC with the key for all the locked doors in the previous floors.</p> Lower Deck 2 -Lounge- <p></p> About this floor <p>Welcome to the farming floor. You will mainly be seeing this floor after coming up from the Lower Deck 1 Harken to farm the chests that spawn nearby the entrance. There are more scripted fights here related to the main story that will all take place in submerged areas. Remember to bring scrolls for your spellcasters!</p> Upper Deck -Arena- <p></p> About this floor <p>There are no enemies of this floor, but there are a lot of mandatory deaths here.

However, it is not as simple as walking from Zone 8 to Zone 9. It will be a walk from Zone 8 to Zone 10 and then falling down to the Zone 9 Harken. There is no need to walk through one-way doors.</li> <li>Luckily, you won't need to explore a whole floor each time but rather just small portions of each floor. It is recommended however to carry a lot of consumables before continuing, as the Sentries on this floor are a lot stronger than previous floors.</li> </ol> Walkthrough 1st Run (2nd Half from Zone 9 to Zone 8 back to Zone 9) <ul> <li>You will drop down and the nearby door is blocked by corruption.

There will be a demonstration of using the Right Hand Reversal mechanic to use Golems to step on buttons near the end of this half.</li> </ul> Walkthrough 2nd Run and onwards (2nd Half from Zone 9 to Zone 8 back to Zone 9) <ol> <li>When dropping down this time, the room that was previously blocked by corruption is now open. You must go into this room to obtain the request for saving Liam. There is also a rag in this room that triggers a Corruption Sentry if obtained, but is necessary for saving Liam unharmed. You can Cursed Wheel away the corruption stack from this encounter.          2. In addition, you can use the Right Hand Reversal mechanic to bypass the Corruption Sentry in the bottom left of the map.</li> </ol> <p></p> Zone 9 -Fortress 2F Entrance- <p></p> Enemies <ul> <li>Combat Sentry: Cyclops + (2 Succubus + 1 Vampire or 1 Minotaur + 1 Succubus)</li> <li>Combat Sentry: 2 Vampires + 2 Succubus</li> <li>Combat Sentry: 1 Greater Demon + 1 Minotaur'</li> </ul> Walkthrough 1st Run (1st Half from Zone 9 to Zone 10) <ul> <li>There may be a room that will lock behind you on this floor.

This drop you into the sight of the Corruption Sentry, but right outside of the Zone 9 Harken.</li> </ul> Walkthrough 1st Run (2nd Half Straight to the Duke) <ul> <li>There is a fountain to heal up at before heading to the final room. There are a lot of sentry patrols on this floor, but they can all be avoided by carefully tailing behind them. The statue rooms are not relevant on the 1st run but can be used to hide from the sentries if you get seen. After arriving at the final room, you can begin the GWO fight by interacting with the lever further down from the room.</li> </ul> Walkthrough 2nd Run and onwards (1st Half Zone 9 to Zone 10 to Zone 9) <ol> <li>The Corruption Sentry in this path can be avoided now. You will need to do the puzzle that is initiated by pushing the golem in the room nearby through the wall. There will be a skeleton on the floor that needs to be interacted with, which will then spawn a doll and map on the floor nearby. The map will mark 3 locations on the previous two floors that you will need to backtrack to in order to pick up wind-up keys for the doll automaton. The 3 locations will always be the same regardless of map configuration. After obtaining 3 wind-up keys, return to the doll in the Zone 10 room and interact with it. Afterwards, walk to the tile right outside of the Corruption Sentry's sight.<ul> <li>Zone 9: X:7, Y:12</li> <li>Zone 8: X:4, Y:9 | X:7, Y:19</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>In the room before dropping down to the Corruption Sentry, you can open a different hole with a Golem so you don't get seen. </p> <p></p> </li> </ol> Walkthrough 2nd Run and onwards (2nd Half straight to the Duke) <ul> <li>It's generally the same this time. Depending on which ending run you are there may be different things to do though. You don't need to interact with the Lever this time and can just walk directly to the ramparts of the castle.</li> </ul> Path to boss <p>In order to reach the boss, you must circle around to the other side of the stone pillar and interact with it.

It will generally spam an AOE frontline attack, but can sometimes do a column attack. Very rarely, it will decide to basic attack. Every 4 turns, it will rebuff itself for another 4 turns. When it's about to die, it will buff itself with an accuracy buff and damage buff for 4 turns that isn't as strong as its usual buff. However, the attack buff does not stack with the other attack buff, but the accuracy buffs stack. This golem has around 24k HP and uses Core Activation when it has around 5-6k HP remaining.</p> <p>Boss: Defensive Golem</p> <p>It will buff itself on turn 1 for extremely high defense/magic defense. It also has the same moveset as the Offensive Golem in which it spams an AOE frontline attack or a column attack. It occasionally uses basic attacks. Every 4 turns, it will rebuff itself with the def/mdef buff (despite it having no duration). When it's about to die, it will buff itself with an accuracy buff and damage buff that are very mild for 4 turns. This golem has around 10k HP and uses Core Activation when it has around 2k HP remaining.</p> Saving the Dog and Adventurers <p>If you choose to save both the dog and adventurers at the same time, you will need to fight BOTH, and the def/mdef buff of the defensive golem applies to the offensive golem (but not the other way around for the offensive buff). If you choose to save only either one, you will still need to fight both golems, but one at a time instead.</p> Strategy <p>Strategy: If your team is fast enough, you have 1 turn to burn the golems for as much HP as possible in 1 turn. You need to use defense penetration skills or have relatively high attack preferably using 2h Weapons with enough substats.</p> <p>Once the golems buff, you should have the ninja use dissipation on the offensive golem. You can further reduce their damage by casting Balafeos or smacking the golems with Staff of Weakness.</p> <p>Repeat until both are dead. Use heals as often as possible. It's entirely possible to evade the golems as well with enough evasion (180+) especially if the accuracy buff is dissipated as well (the attack buff is removed first).</p> <p>The defensive golem will likely die first, and the offensive golem will actually remove its invulnerability buff once it reaches near death because of Core Activation. Dissipation still removes the damage buff first. It will still have quite a bit of HP so continue the strategy and only attack when it has 1 turn of accuracy left. </p> <p>It's generally recommended to use 2H for this fight as these golems have very high defense. If you'd like to play it safe, Knight's Defense is an option here to tank 1 turn of undissipated damage. Samurai quickdraw stance here is also very effective as the golems can only cast physical attacks.</p> Additional Notes <ul> <li>If you only save the dog, you get nothing but the stated gold in the request.</li> </ul> Rewards <p>If you save both the dog and the adventurers, you will receive the bondmate \"Eugen and Bibi\" which is a void element bondmate with confusion tolerance.</p>"},{"location":"abyss-guides/3-guarda-fortress/requests/#emergency-occurrence","title":"Emergency Occurrence","text":"Requirements <p>Stopped the Mastermind</p> <p>This request leads to a boss fight that is arguably more difficult than that of the average fight with the GWO of this abyss.</p> <ol> <li>After accepting the quest, head to Edge of Town to receive more information.</li> <li>Head to Zone 3 -Old Secret Passage B3F- and walk slightly north of the Harken.</li> </ol> Enemies <p>Enemies</p> <p></p> <p>Boss: Necrocore</p> <p>This boss will always act three times at the start of the fight.

It will then cast \"March of the Undead\" which will grant a 10 turn Attack, Accuracy and Defense buff to all enemies. Finally, it will randomly use a skill from a standard Necrocore.

Try not to use Light element adventurers, as all the damage done by the enemies are Dark. It's very recommended to have Assault guard level 1 on all the frontline (Not necessary if you have multiple light gear)</p> <p>Backline:     Two priests are preferred, especially if at least one of them can cast mage skills (Kantios). They ideally should both have Madios LvL 3+ and Makaltu Lvl 3+. If you do not have a Knight in the frontline OR are using the Knight for DPS purposes only, you WILL need a knight SPECIFICALLY to cast Knight's Defense. Assault Guard is preferred on all the backline as well. (You do not need a knight if you have multiple pieces of light gear)</p> <p>The Knight casting Knight's Defense needs to be slower than all other party members, but still be around ~70 ASPD give or take a few to not be outsped later in the fight by the Necrocore. </p> <p>Generally speaking, you should try to have Light gear (dark resistance) for the boss if normal gear isn't doing enough damage.</p> <p>Strategy:     Essentially, this fight is a DPS race to see whether your team can kill the Necrocore before it wipes your team. The fight will ALWAYS start out as an Ambush, and as such, the Necrocore always gets a free hit on your party. He hits EXTREMELY hard and easily deals 500+ damage on an assault guarded frontline with 300+ defense. It's acceptable to restart if he does Spear Thrust instead of Zelos or Mazelos, as those are not affected by the attack buff he casts. Essentially you will be spamming Full Power Strike on Fighters OR Heavy Attack/Precision Strike/Armor Pierce LVL 3+ every turn on ONLY the Necrocore, as the fight will end once the Necrocore dies. Makaltu will help a lot with surviving the onslaught of damage every turn, as it's quite a lot EVEN with Knight's Defense. Two priests are preferred, as you often will need to cast Madios Lvl 3+ on both rows. When you do not need to heal, attempt to cast Kantios on the back row and then the front row. This will reduce the amount of damage you may take, as most of the basic enemies have Instant Kill moves or skills that deal a lot of AOE damage. It's also preferrable for the support adventurers to carry nourishing draught if you need more turns to deal with the Necrocore.</p> Additional Notes <ul> <li>Dissipation does not work here very well, as the Necrocore rebuffs on turn 5.

It is unlocked after defeating the Greater Warped One in the Beginning Abyss, and can be accessed from the Edge of Town in the Royal Capital.  </p> <p>All Dens are 1 floor dungeons where chests can give you Blacksmithing Ore of different grades required for ehnancing gear beyond +4 and Elemental armor and weapon junk matching the Den. (Earth, fire, air, and water gear are steel grade.)  Each den has one or two Boss fights on the way to the exit portal.    </p> <p>Den maps are obscured each time the Den is entered, with the Entrance and Exit (portal) tiles always visible. All other map tiles are variable, and randomly change layout each time the Den is entered.   </p> Boss Fights <p>The Earth Den has a mini boss fight just outside the portal room with a Big Slime, and a final boss fight with a Hydra Plant moster (Earth type, vulnerable to Air), both accompanied by a random group of Earth Den monsters.</p> Exploration and Farming Strategy <p>For the Earth Den (and most other Dens) the map reset prevents auto-moving to efficiently collect chests on the map. So the most efficient ore and junk farming strategy is usually to rush straight to the boss for guaranteed chest drops while picking up any nearby spawned chests along the way.  Sprung traps are permanently revealed, however, so full exploration is of value once on each map tile variation to expose traps.  After a few rounds of exploration enough tiles should be explored and traps revealed to allow safe progress to the boss on further trips.</p> <p>Without knowing the map layout, the fastest boss route is often to leave the entry tile from the south east room, then work west and north through the middle tiles, to enter the exit tile on the upper east side, as generally indicated on the main map below. The acutal path can vary significantly on some map variations.</p> <p>Den of Earth Maps</p> <p>The Earth Den is a 2x3 map.  The entry map, tileset, and a several map variations are shown below. This is obviously an incomplete set.  Rather than tiles 'swapping' like Abyss map variations, there appears to be at least three variations for each of the four hidden tiles, suggesting at least 3^4=81 full map combinations.  </p> <p>That said, all 3x4=12 tile variations only need to be explored once for the traps to be permanently exposed for future runs.

The change to her unique skill from <code>Water Formation</code> to <code>Grace of the Great Tree</code> is arguably a downgrade. <code>Grace of the Great Tree</code> will give Flut a minor boost to her Magic Power and Defense, however losing the <code>Water Formation</code> buff could have implications later in the game if single element parties become more widespread.</p> <p>As of her release, <code>Water Formation</code> can already be utilized by having a back row of Flut, Alice, and either Philip or Viviana. If Alice was made into a mage, the <code>Water Formation</code> damage boost for her would already surpass the personal damage boost that Flut would gain from <code>Grace of the Great Tree</code>. This is arguably a negligible gain currently due to the lack of any difficult Fire-type content, however the moment that content gets released, <code>Water Formation</code> has the potential to be much more valuable than <code>Grace of the Great Tree</code>. Furthermore, <code>Grace of the Great Tree</code> is a boost when she has a two-handed staff equipped, which completely contrasts with one of her two possible classes. You'd currently never have one equipped if you changed her class to run her as a Warrior.</p> <p>As far as <code>Gift of Spell Genius</code> goes, this is another arguably downgrade to <code>Young Spell Prodigy</code> due to Gift no longer providing an increased Magic Power boost at higher Discipline levels.</p> <p>In terms of role competition, Flut is already surpassed by Mage Alice in terms of utility, so unless you're already running Flut in your party, there's nothing overly enticing about her Mage of the Silent Night kit that would make me consider adding her.</p> <p>Lastly, if you're interested in her strictly for her appearance, everyone will be getting a free <code>Remains of the Mage Praying on the Silent Night</code> bone on Day 6 of the Sacred Feast Special Supplies.</p> <p>Ultimately, this is the first banner the game has introduced that I recommend completely ignoring, as there is essentially zero incentive to use her over standard Flut.</p> TheAxolotl's Pull Plan <p>I got a free copy and that was it.

Being a Fighter, she gains access to the highest Strength -&gt; Attack Power conversion, on top of some solid damage multipliers and Full-Power Strike. Furthermore, she gains Attack Power with her Discipline levels, which is great.</p> <p>The passive damage boost from her Flickering Fang skill appears to be roughly in the 20% ballpark, although we're still testing out slayer sill damage. This has the potential to be a solid damage increase for her given how frequently we run into magical beasts. The big difference between this and something like a damage boost to Entites or Undead is that the latter start out with innate resistance to physical weapons, while the former doesn't. In many cases, this could end up as a \"kill harder\" bonus where the damage boost is effectively wasted because you already would have done enough damage to the enemy. It'll definitely be more valuable against magical beast bosses, though. Unfortunately, this skill only boosts her own damage and does not extend to party members.</p> <p>Her Flutterdream Flash skill is extremely unique and fun. It's a \"Minor physical attack\" that has enough potency to outright kill a weaker enemy at the start of battle or to take out a nice chunk of health. In addition, the accuracy debuff can be very handy, especially when stacked with something like DILTO. It's unfortunate that this skill is only one use per fight. Abenius will always trigger this skill at the start of the battle unless the battle starts with an ambush, however when inherited to another adventurer, the activation rate and damage drops significantly (roughly 20% on the activation and damage is reduced to roughly 60% of a basic attack). Note that skill inheritance increases the damage of the skill, as well as the amount of accuracy reduced, but it does not increase activation rate or the chance to trigger the accuracy reduction.</p> <p>Abenius' class change of a Priest may seem like an odd one at first glance, but it's worth dipping into for some added buff support on top of gaining Priest Weapon Mastery for a minor passive Attack Power increase. Given that we now have seen katanas with Attack Power and Magic Power on them, it's not outside of the realm of possibility that we'll get future weapons with Attack Power and Divine Power, which would be a perfect fit for Abenius to use.</p> <p>One of the things I really like about Abenius is that her signature skill does not lose value as additional skills get released in the future due to its nature of being an automatic trigger at the start of battle and not an active skill that could become easily powercrept by future active skills (I'm looking at you, Gerard).</p> Frobro's Analysis <p>Certainly more interesting than most other figures. For starters, Like Yekaterina, Abenius has been extremely lucky with the kinds of enemies and events that have been common in the game from Abyss 2 to 3. Abenius does extra damage and receives reduced damage from solid chunk of common enemies thanks to her, Magical Beast-slayer passive. This feels even stronger with the ease of farming and crafting the perfect Horned Eagle Sword from Fordraig.</p> <p>Flutterdream Flash may seem low impact in a vacuum, but if you stop and realize that it is a guaranteed turn 0 hit in every single non-ambush battle, you notice that Abenius likely has done more lifetime damage of most units in the game. I understand the hesitation, but this is a solid use for Codexes assuming you use Abenius often. You\u2019ll get your money\u2019s worth from it so to speak.</p> <p>The discipline is cool, it seems like with the release of abyss 3, going forward we can expect to see more enemies use status ailments against us. Being resistant to 2 of the more debilitating statuses for physical attackers (Charm/Confuse) while getting more attack comes off as better than most. </p> <p>Simple but effective. Not exactly flashy, but still one of the best fighters in the game.</p> Shiro's Analysis <p>Starting from her inheritance we have basically free attack on the enemy. While in case of harder enemies/bosses the impact is quite small and rarely will make a difference (assuming it\u2019s not leveled) the case is different if we got for all around dungeon clear or for farming purposes. In those cases it's a good push towards faster fights. Whenever it kills one of the enemies in the group or slightly weakens a stronger one doing not only damage but also giving him ACC debuff. In the end it's a really good skill for self inheritance but not so good on others because of lowered activation rate.</p> <p>Moving on to her passive, it's a really amazing one especially for second abyss/middle floors of third abyss or both Le Bicken and Hundredfold Blossom caves. Not only does her passive buff her damage vs Magical Beast but also reduces damage received from them. Lucky for her those are really common enemy types so she\u2019ll have a good bunch of time to shine.</p> <p>Moving to her discipline. While in the earlier phase of the game I was really skeptical of her and Lana's, it turned out to be a really good one as we arrive in abyss 3 and we have quite a few enemies that tend to proc charm/confusion. And those are one of the most annoying statuses. It\u2019s one of rare cases where I\u2019d say that it\u2019s worth going for a disc. </p> <p>Her class change is priest, which is one of my favorite options for fighter class. Having it saved me really many times against annoying statuses from enemies like vampire/succubus/gorgon. Not only is it good for cleanse and sometimes emergency healing (assuming you carry staff and you\u2019re not too lazy to swap weapons). But it\u2019s also a good potential for faster fight setup on bosses giving you more buffers in a team and speeding up for example porto on everyone. Overall very solid class change for supportive reasons. On top of it Priest Weapon Mastery helps a bit with attack.</p> <p>To sum it up I believe that Abenius is one of best options when it comes for a fighter (and the best one for general content) thanks to having overall really solid class options, unique passive, inheritance and discipline. I would personally invest in inheritance firstly because it\u2019ll be useful in more situations than more charm/conf resistance but in the end it's a matter of personal opinion on what you find best. Her only downgrade is that her unique doesn\u2019t active on ambush.

Reducing the dampening of damage means he's not as impacted when fighting enemies that are strong against Light damage. His main downside is that he innately only can deal Light damage. This can be offset by inheriting some single target spells that deal other elements of damage, however without the inheritance, he will only have an elemental advantage against enemies weak to light.</p> <p>Changing his class to Priest will give him a wider selection of spells, as well, making him a very well-rounded Adventurer for support or damage purposes.</p> <p>His inheritable unique skill gets an extra nod in that if it is inherited by another character, that character will receive the full bonus of the damage dampening. This has some nice quality of life potential to boost the damage dealt by the MC (or your favorite damage dealers) against unfavorable element type matchups when they weild elemental weapons. Note that this skill does not have any impact on Undead or Entity resistance to non-spell attacks.</p> <p>Compared to Yekaterina, his damage will generally be more consistent, and he will be able to cast more spells overall, however he will be missing out on the bonus damage to undead and multiple innate elemental type coverages. This can be overcome by inheriting other spells on him to give him additional elemental coverage. Early game, the extra longevity will be nice, but will become less relevant as MP pools get higher and MP potions become obtainable. Still, he's an excellent pull and you have many options for spending his duplicates.</p> <p>Millennial Lord Adam is our third mergeable adventurer and a surprisingly solid sidegrade to the standard Adam. Madam's Discipline is weaker and may present a mental hurdle for folks that have invested heavily into the Standard Discipline, however his gains conditionally offset that loss.</p> <p>In particular, Light Shaft's Radiance gives a nice conditional damage boost that has two primary components to it. The first is an Elise and Milana-style column boost of ~10% to himself and the paired Light adventurer. This skill is not like Rinne's where it's active for her all the time. Adam must be paired with a Light type adventurer for either of them to see the bonus. As of now, the biggest candidate for this pairing is Abenius. The second component of this buff kicks in when facing a Dark type enemy, and that's an additional ~15% damage boost that behaves similarly to the Formation skills.</p> <p>Unlike Holiday Flut, who was generally considered worse than standard Flut, this skill change makes Adam a solid conditional support for Abenius (and other future Light type adventurers), even more so when facing Dark type enemies. One big consideration, though, is that his damage buff does nothing to reduce damage received from Dark type enemies, so running Adam in situations where he could die quickly (such as late in the Fortress and Catacombs) would still be just as risky. The second big consideration is right now, there are very few situations where you'd really be able to take advantage of the additional ~15% damage due to there not being too many major Dark type fights. The biggest one at the moment is going to be Morgus.</p> <p>Personally, I actually think Madam is stronger than Adam since I put relatively little value on Discipline, however I still probably wouldn't have a spot for him in my party unless I was building something explicitly for a single fight.</p> Frobro's Analysis StandardMillennial Lord <p>Seriously, how is this guy evil-aligned again? Whatever, I\u2019ll try to make this one short, Shelirionach took his job!</p> <p>Adam is positioned as this sorta damage-focused Mage compared to others. As a light element mage, his spells tend to hit most things for neutral, but in the rare occasion that it is resisted, his Wisdom of Truth overrides it. Because his Knowledge of the Millennial Lord passive gives him a cost reduction in the narrow band of 3-10MP cost spells, he is allowed to use single-target and row-target damaging spells a little more carelessly than other mages even when the type matchups are out of his favor. With the stacked MP savings, he is also slightly more enabled to use his \u201cdelete all\u201d button, Secrets of Laforos which he has just \u2018cuz.</p> <p>To offset his fragility as a elf mage he has an RNG-based damage mitigation skill baked into his inherit skill. This means he can feel that much tankier than other mages when using a 2-hand staff instead of a 1-hander and shield. Adam also has a strong discipline focus of Magic Power and Action Speed. Hit harder and faster, no complaints.</p> <p>Now, do you know who else is damage spell spamming, RNG damage mitigating, Mag Power + ASPD focused demon from hell? It doesn\u2019t help that she uses Adam\u2019s Wisdom of truth better than he does. Adam could just cast other elemental spells when needed, but Shelirionach\u2019s Slumbering Darkness is always dark. In the end, there are worse things to be than the 2nd best at a particular role.</p> <p>I figured Legendary alts would be straight upgrades after Wandering Princess Lanavaille, but this is a sidegrade at best and a downgrade if you already have high discipline on Adam. This new discipline focus is worse; MP &amp; ASPD would have suited him better if they wanted to go for something that\u2019s good for both Priest &amp; Mage. The column buff is cool, but it really only has 3 good targets for it right now and light in particular feels like the worst elemental type to be.</p> <p>If you want to switch MC to light and pretend you and your husbando are righting wrongs, holding hands and spreading light throughout the world of Wizardy; this is the unit for you! Otherwise, a mage who isn\u2019t Shelirionach? SKIP!</p> Karkarov's Analysis Millennial Lord <p>\"So the new alt skin character is revealed and it is ... MADAM!  For some this may be bad news, but Adam as a character has always been underrated in my view.</p> <p>Only two things have changed (outside aesthetics) for Madam, the discipline is now MP and Resistance boosted, and the unique skill gives a column damage buff if both members of the column are Light Element.  Compare this to original Adam whose discipline is argueably the best a Mage can get Magic Power and Action Speed boosted, and a unique skill that reduces MP cost on spells that are 3-10 MP.</p> <p>As a result, it is clear that Madam on paper is not a straight upgrade to Adam unlike Wana and Lana.  The discipline is simply worse than normal Adam, but Madam has a superior unique skill with damage buff potential, even more so when fighting Dark Element enemies.  It is situational however and relies on your party comp using a strong front line Light character such as Abenius.  If you do have the party make up to support it, there is more long term value there than the normal Adam's MP reduction skill.  Also who knows what characters will be introduced long term and how this will impact future value.</p> <p>Ultimately I think Madam is a better character than Adam, and I would rate him from a \"\"just the character\"\" evaluation as the second best Mage in the game at this time (6/19/25).  He is still not up to par with our Sleepy Queen Sheli, but he is closer than other Mages.  Madam is a character that will show their true value months after their release, it will depend on what Drecom releases and if more strong Light front liners are imminent.\"                                    </p> Shiro's Analysis StandardMillennial Lord <p>Starting with inheritance we got one of best possible picks in the game that I absolutely recommend to have on everyone you use on at least lvl 1. Not only it removes dampening of damage but it gives you (rng based) reduction of damage and bonus MP. The removal of dampening is game changing for any elemental skills/weapons/mages which lets you go against enemies that usually would resist you without DMG drop. On top of that damage reduction while rng based gives you better long run survivability especially if you have other sources of damage reducing passives/skills. At the same time it\u2019s Adam's weak point because his inheritance is so good that it\u2019s generally better to invest it in your team over investing in him.</p> <p>Moving on his passive it's a great economy helper that shines mostly in first and second abyss. Sadly for whatever reason it\u2019s capped on 10 cost abilities thus reducing its impact on third abyss. Unless the values won\u2019t change it basically means that from the third abyss onward his passive is basically non existent.</p> <p>Moving to discipline while it\u2019s great to have magic power and SPD the difference between it and base disc stat growth is minimal so it\u2019s nothing to write poems about. It\u2019s nice but that\u2019s all.</p> <p>His class change is priest which is the best available class change for mages. It gives access to MP based cleanse and supportive skillset. And if you don\u2019t have good gear for mages but you have some good light armor gear pieces it allows you for more flexibility when you stay in this class. Absolutely one of best class synergies in the game.</p> <p>To sum it up Adam is an amazing mage and I\u2019d say he\u2019s among five best mages we have in the game right now (2025). If you do like him then he\u2019s definitely worth investing and using. But if you want to go for the best pick it might be better to use him as inheritance and go with other mages like Alice, Miliana or Sheli. In the end it's a matter of personal preference. But Adam is never a wrong choice or bad pull.</p> <p>Madam is a great alternative to Adam. That\u2019s if you use his passive. Basically if you use Debra, Clarissa or Abenius as damage dealer you can push their DMG really hard against dark enemies just by having him behind them which is a really solid option and upgrade over his normal passive in later parts of the game. But that\u2019s only if you have a light adventurer to support.</p> <p>As for his discipline it\u2019s downgraded for mage class while it\u2019s upgraded towards his priest class. You can\u2019t go wrong with more MP and having a bit more resistance even if highly unlikely might make a difference one day.</p> <p>To sum up Adam's alternative costume is much less of a solo/ego character and seems to lean to be a good priest option, and honestly? It\u2019s one of the best ones if you can make use of it. Definitely a must pull for Adam fans but in the end it matters how well you can fill him in the team and whenever you have or not other options that fit you better.</p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/details/Adam/#adventurer-pull-plans","title":"Adventurer Pull Plans","text":"TheAxolotl's Pull Plan <p>While I like the changes to Adam's kit here, he's likely a pass for me just because I'd be hard-pressed to fit him in my party most of the time.

Thank you devs for teasing everyone with your silhouettes. There are quite a few unknowns around his damage scaling, but in general, I personally think Aldric is the first legendary thief that actually looks like they're great at doing what thieves are supposed to do, which is opening chests.</p> <p>His damage skill, Blunt Combo Strike, is very unique, but it is also what we're currently least clear on. First, what we do know:</p> <ul> <li>Regardless of weapon type used (Dagger, Sword, Bow), both the initial minor attack and the crow attacked are treated as a spear. This has some significant implications for its use, both positive and negative.</li> <li>Undead Slayer is the only weapon-based damage boost that works with the crow. This means other slayer properties as well as elemental type properties do not work with the crow portion, but they do work with the initial minor attack.</li> <li>The initial minor attack can trigger procs like Corrosion Dagger, Mace of Tumult, and Staff of Weakness, but the crow attack cannot.</li> <li>The initial minor attack is not forced to a single hit and instead uses the number of hits provided by the weapon, plus an additional hit for the crow. For example, using a 2-hit weapon, his skill hits a total of 3 times and using a 3-hit weapon, his skill hits a total of 4 times</li> <li>Despite the <code>Details</code> page of this skill indicating that there are efficacy increases with higher skill levels, since this is his non-inheritable skill, it is currently locked at level 1, so we can't actually increase its skill level.</li> </ul> <p>The evade and counter component of this skill is also pretty negligible. While it is boosted by an Alice inherit, it's only actually going to provide damage if he evades something, which means he needs to be attacked by an attack that can be evaded and countered. If this does actually happen, it'll be crow damage, which is nice. Unfortunately, it's not going to be too reliable.</p> <p>As far as what we don't know, we really have no idea how the damage of either component scale at higher attack power levels. Since the initial attack on his skill is credited as a <code>Minor</code> attack, my suspicion is it'll see its power soft cap at around 300-350 attack power. The crow component on the other hand is different and I suspect behaves more like Sheli's sleepy nuke. More testing needs to be done here, though. I'll update this section as we learn more.</p> <p>Moving on to his inheritable skill, Wisdom of the Crafty Old Dwarf is tailored towards being a thief, which is great. That being said, the actual increases are pretty small. On him at skill level 1, it increases his Detect and Evade Trap each by 2 and his Disarm Trap by 5. These are reduced to 1, 1, and 3 respectively when inherited to someone else. The table above will gradually get filled out as we see what the inherited value increases are. The downside of this skill is that it's a pretty low value - on him, it's roughly equivalent to a single Bakesh inherit and a bit over 2 Jean inherits. One someone else, it's roughly equivalent to 1/2 Bakesh and 1 Jean inherit.</p> <p>His Discipline skill, Adept's Rule of Thumb, is going to be very similar to his inherit in that it'll be improving his disarming abilities at a minor rate. Detect and Disarm Trap are definitely two of the stats that get better value out of Discipline, but it's still going to be a relatively low value per dupe in general.</p> <p>The biggest hurdles that Aldric needs to overcome are the fact that he's a thief and the fact that there's already a lot of competition for both rows within a party. Many veteran players stopped using thieves quite a long time ago and have instead made MC or a ninja their disarmer. As such, his value is going to be relatively low for parties with established disarmers. Given the uncertainty at this point around his damage longevity, it's hard to immediately recommend him as a long-term member in a party since thief damage drops off pretty significantly in the later content. That being said, if you want to run a thief, he's going to be the best thief in the game right now at doing a thief's job of disarming traps. If you use a ninja like Rinne as your disarmer instead, inheriting him to her definitely couldn't hurt, but he's also a fairly easy skip.</p> Frobro's Analysis <p>Well, well, well; he\u2019s a thief alright. If opening chests is what you need, this guy has the capacity to be the best in the game at it. Both a chest opening-based discipline focus and inherit; all function, no flash. It's not a particularly tempting offer given the alternative of \u201cgit gud\u201d costs $0, but maybe future chests will be difficult for non-chest specialized thieves to open? Is this what the streets wanted; A chest opening legendary?</p> <p>Now that unique is something; it\u2019s kinda like Sheli\u2019s if you squint. It's a decently strong attack that kinda costs 0sp to use, but has a prerequisite attached to it and you can\u2019t cast it directly\u2026mostly. I am of course referring to the Bird-counter part of the attack specifically. After the turn you use the skill, you need to be targeted by an attack that can be evaded &amp; counter-attacked and you must evade the attack. A few things need to go your way to get more than 1 bird hit, but it is possible and you are guaranteed 1 on the turn you use the skill, so it can seem like an equivalent to Sheli\u2019s at a glance. Defense penetration can be incredibly strong. The Bird\u2019s damage is not subject to the range penalty, even if you don\u2019t have a bow equipped and its damage doesn\u2019t seem tied to ATK power. While I am unsure how it scales with DEX exactly but, at the current lvl cap, it is pretty strong but heavily reliant on getting surety. </p> <p>Beyond that, as a standalone skill\u2026yikes. It\u2019s Black Beast Feint that replaces the row aggro ailment with a minor attack + 1 bird hit for 5 more SP. You\u2019d have to use high-leveled Attract Hit or Defensive Provoke separately to expect to get max value from this skill. So now you need to inherit an Alice to extend the buffs for maximum effect. Also, this skill cannot be leveled up with codexes. Compared to Slumbering Darkness\u2019s easy prerequisite, direct MAG power scaling and negative MP cost, it really feels like the devs dropped some hot \u201cmid\u201d again.</p> <p>Despite the rant, Aldric is probably the best thief in the game at max potential, but not so much so that many veteran players are replacing their invested thief over.</p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/details/Aldric/#adventurer-pull-plans","title":"Adventurer Pull Plans","text":"TheAxolotl's Pull Plan <p>I'm likely going to skip him.

Not only is she our first Legendary priest, but both of her skills are fantastic. Increasing her buff/debuff turn count by 1 means she gets an extra turn to heal, deal damage, or apply another buff/debuff before needing to reapply the initial. Furthermore, her damage increase to a row can apply to many af our strongest damage dealers.</p> <p>Changing her class to Mage will give her a wider selection of spells, as well, making her a very well-rounded Adventurer for support or damage purposes.</p> <p>To make things even better, many other characters will benefit from Alice duplicates. Inheriting her skill on your other favorite buffers/debuffers will allow them to each provide an extra turn for their buffs/debuffs!</p> <p>The turn duration increase from her Blessing of Agora skill adds one to the counter at rank three (on Alice, rank 5 on non-Alice), so it's possible to get at least a 5-turn duration on buffs and debuffs, which adds to the strength increasing her skill through inheritence.</p> <p>If you pull Alice, she will be a fantastic addition to your team!</p> Frobro's Analysis <p>Simple but effective. It didn\u2019t take much to be the best in slot at what she does. Optimized stat line from Water/Elf/Female and has the ideal double caster class set. The best buffer/debuffer in the game; being able to reach a turn cap that other characters cannot. A rock-solid unit when used and desirable inherit when not. </p> <p>A passive 10% damage increase with an easily met condition for the whole row. Has access to an, as of now unreleased spell with her Secrets of Labadios just \u2018cuz. An alright discipline focus with Divine Power and Magic Def; not good, not bad. The MP gains from leveling up Blessing of Agora feels like she has 3rd discipline anyway.</p> <p>You can change her into a mage (after learning all priest spells first) and sacrifice some HP/armor and gain some MP and the entire suite of mage spells, with practically no loss of healing potency.</p> <p>There isn\u2019t much to say; this chick excels in the roles that units like her were designed to play and has some staying power with her inherit should the game ever shift to being more buff/debuff-centric.</p> Shiro's Analysis <p>Starting with her inheritance we have access to basically \u201ccheat\u201d and arguably best inheritance in the game. Having bonus one or two turn duration on any character or even up to four Alice is absurdly game changing for any buff/debuff rotation allowing things like lasting warrior battlecry enough for two FPS rotations. It\u2019s even more impactful on priests and mages, giving them bonus free turns for any sort of healing, more consistent rotations, usage of items or additional damage. Some people seriously downplay how strong is passive that basically breaks one of game rules. Great to have lvl 1 on everyone and maxed out on Alice. You\u2019ll be playing two different games depending if you have it or not.</p> <p>Moving to her passive. It\u2019s lane DMG buff which is nice but I\u2019m personally not really impressed by those whenever it\u2019s Alice or Lana. It\u2019s nice to min max damage and it might help but the impact isn\u2019t that strong unless you stack multiple of them (like Milana or Madam on top of it) so in the end it\u2019s still a solid option especially if you run Alice as mage.</p> <p>Moving to her discipline while it\u2019s somewhat nice to have I wouldn\u2019t even consider investing in it especially when her inheritance is so powerful. Might be a different case if we get her alternative style in future but I can\u2019t imagine what kind of disc it would need to have to even compete with another option to use her additional copies. </p> <p>Her class change is mage. Which is absolutely the best option available with access to more MP based spells, offensive abilities or debuffs. Especially impactful on Alice with access up to four bonus turns on everything she cast. On top of that she has the perfect setup to be a mage leaving poor Adam behind and being able to compete with Sheli having edge over the supportive part while falling in pure damage to her. </p> <p>To sum it up Alice is an absurdly strong option for both priest and mage. And honestly? Our arguably best caster that is sometimes downplayed.

It hits hard and provides a solid damage option for thieves. It's very costly SP-wise, at 20 SP for level 1, and being an elf, he already has a smaller SP pool than Debra, who is going to be his most common competitor. This skill is effectively an attack that simultaneously casts <code>PORTO</code> on himself and the adventurer in front of or behind him. At a glance, this seems pretty strong, but there are a few considerations. First, <code>PORTO</code> in itself is a conditional buff since it causes no impact on the turn it is used. When you're killing things fast, the <code>PORTO</code> portion of <code>Astral Break</code> will go to waste. For more extended fights, there's definitely value in it, but it's possible you could mess up your own turn order by getting <code>PORTO</code> simultaneously on one of the fastest adventurers in your party as well as presumably a slower one. Second, the fact that this buffs in a column means you have to pay extra close attention to your formation, as you'll want to position Arboris in front of someone that could gain value from the <code>PORTO</code> buff and have it actually impact the flow of a fight. Third, the <code>PORTO</code> portion is a buff, which makes it subject to the three buff limit, so if you use him, you'll want to keep that in mind.</p> <p><code>Lord of the Deep Forest's Leadership</code> at a glance seems like solid evil and neutral support, however it also has some issues. First and foremost is that for the two skills being buffed, it is very hard to evaluate the effectiveness of the buffs. It is a Synergy that behaves similar to Rinne's Surety boost, always applying to him and extending to others that meet the criteria. Since it is a Synergy, that means we are unable to see the exact amount being modified, so it's a bit of a guess to know if it's even providing value. Initial testing currently seems to point to it being bugged and not doing anything, but we can't say for sure at this time. I'll update again when we know more. Assuming it is working, there are a few main scenarios I can think of where the action speed boost from <code>Lord of the Deep Forest's</code> may or may not be relevant.</p> <ul> <li>You are perfectly speed-tuned to go ahead of most enemies you face and your buffers/debuffers always go before your damage dealers<ul> <li>In this scenario, gaining some passive action speed won't do much for you since it won't change your turn order and it won't make you outspeed enemies more than you're already outspeeding them</li> </ul> </li> <li>You have not spent much if any effort on speed tuning your party but you have made it so your party always goes before most enemies<ul> <li>In this scenario, the action speed could be nice, but you probably won't notice much of an impact since you aren't too worried about your party's turn order in general</li> </ul> </li> <li>You have speed tuned your party to go in the order you want but some of your party is still being outsped by enemies<ul> <li>In this scenario, you might see some benefit, as the action speed gains could be enough to finish getting your party going before the enemy, however it'll be variable based on the enemies you face. For example, vampires seem to have somewhere around 115 speed, and this synergy is very unlikely to be able to help you reach that.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>One potential consideration is that you could cut down on some of your ASPD blessings on certain adventurers because you know that they'd be getting the action speed from <code>Lord of the Deep Forest's</code> however that isn't something I'd really advise since we don't know the magnitude of the buff.</p> <p>I'm generally not a big fan of Discipline skills to begin with, so this will be short - in general, <code>King's Disposition</code> is absolute garbage as far as Discipline goes.</p> <p>Overall, having a conditional passive speed adjustment for a row and having access to a two-person <code>PORTO</code> could be situationally useful, but for most players, if you want to really mess with speed turning during a battle, using <code>BATILGREF</code> and <code>PORTO</code> will likely be both sufficient and a bit more consistent.</p> Frobro's Analysis <p>I feel like people see something that I just don\u2019t with this one. Let\u2019s start with the good. Astral break is a Major tier damage skill that doesn\u2019t require setup like Sneak Attack, and since thieves are unimpressive in fights, this seems like a way to alleviate that. The cost of 20SP is way too high and the ASPD buff is generally unimpactful and cumbersome when trying to maintain more relevant buffs against the 3 buff limit. As an inherit to others, they\u2019re better off using other damaging skills. It being earth element is lame too.</p> <p>Evil wins again with his passive Evasion and ASPD buff. I thought Wizardy \u201cevil\u201d was supposed to mean more self-centered! On the flipside, this discipline focus is a joke! Accuracy and Stun Tolerance\u2026what?</p> <p>In closing, he\u2019s a thief alright. A skill he can only use a handful of times, anti-synergy between his race/class, one of the worst disciplines in the game and limited availability. There are better general adventurers than this. Mid.</p> Karkarov's Analysis <p>How to sum up this character.... I think I know.  If I took the Drake Sword from Dark Souls 1 and turned it into a Wizardry Variants Daphne character it's name would be \"\"Arboris\"\".</p> <p>This character looks great at low level and in early game content thanks to his ridiculously expensive Astral Break skill that has a great damage floor, but garbage damage ceiling.  His earth element makes him seem top tier in the water paradise of abyss two.  Then you get to the lots of earth enemies abyss three, the SP cost of Astral Break combined with Thief drop off in damage potential makes you realize he isn't that good at doing damage over a long dungeon trip, the increase in enemy surety resistance, accuracy, spell use, blah blah blah.  Then you realize his value is falling so fast it might as well be a rock tossed off a cliff.</p> <p>Just like the Drake Sword he is a newb trap.  Something that is really strong in early game, but long term stops scaling and getting better, and gets surpassed by just about anything if you know what you are doing and how to invest in a character.  </p> <p>To make matters worse he has a terrible discipline (accuracy and stun tolerance boosted), his formation passive rules out good characters and is a very minor stat buff anyway (some I know have tested and suggested it is single digit numbers maybe even as little as 4 or 5 aspd/evasion), and he just got his alt class and it is Priest.</p> <p>Priest does basically nothing to enhance Thief beyond Priest Weapon Mastery which is +20% of your Piety to attack power.  Too bad Elves have low Piety, and Thief is competing for lowest Piety growth in the game.  Expect like 5-6 whole more Attack Power for this epic skill.  Even better all Thief does for Priest is a slight buff to Action Speed and Evasion.  There is just no synergy between these two classes, and with this second class Arboris is doomed to the role of just a support character.  </p> <p>Good luck outsupporting Mage/Priest Alice, Adam, or Yekatarina, or tanking Diva's Savia and El Dorado.  How about Madam with a Light Element character in front, or Mage Milana with Gerulf, or Elise with anyone nuetral, or..... you get it.</p> Shiro's Analysis <p>Starting with his inheritance. While extremely costly it\u2019s one of the best late game options for any fighter/knight/thief. The reason behind is not only really high dmg and def bypass but build in column porto on cast. Having it on all the three rows with a mage that can cast BATILGREF can completely change how a fight will go, making some impossible fights into doable ones. The issue is that skill is extremely weak early game on. Well\u2026 not exactly weak. It\u2019s very costly. So you probably will never use it outside the boss in the first abyss similar to the second abyss. On top of that Arboris SP poll is quite lacking. While earth element and thief class prove a bit of SP it\u2019s still nowhere close to beastfolk. Things change as soon as you hit the third abyss or you\u2019ll have access to Debra\u2019s inheritance/SP relics. With it Astral Break becomes your best stable DPT option as long as you can maintain SP cost, turning a lot of fights (especially harder ones like any sort of superboss or 0C GWO with def up) into much easier ones. But that\u2019s also his curse. Why use Arboris\u2026 if you can just inherit his astral to fighters with 2h weapons?</p> <p>Moving to his passive it\u2019s really good buff for neutral and evil allies. At least on paper. Because while it can buff aspd and eva for up to 3 of characters it\u2019ll rarely show value. Unless you\u2019ll make some extreme speed tuning to balance around it. But then\u2026 gear is RNG based. In the end it might help with hitting some speed break points but it\u2019s highly unlikely.</p> <p>Moving to his discipline. I don\u2019t even know what to write there. It\u2019s one of most useless ones at this moment unless for whatever reason the Necrocore focuses your Arboris all the time and you decide you need STUN immunity because of that. Otherwise I see no value in it.</p> <p>His class change is priest which isn\u2019t a surprise. His astral and passive skills were already selling him a support and devs only went further on it. Which in the end led to not as good as fighters damage dealer, but better supportive ability in battle. Which is still good. Having access to extra cleanse/buff in the middle of a fight in case things go wrong will never be a bad choice unless your brain focuses on \u201cunga bunga\u201d and you want everyone to just hit as hard as possible.</p> <p>To sum it up Arbois is a great option in abyss 2 and gets even better in abyss 3 and later as the game proceeds and we have better SP pools. He\u2019s a thief who leans to a supportive role in your team being 3rd slot fill next to other backliners you use (for example Alice and Adam). Him being a thief and having high ASPD while priest buffs being extremely cheap also allows you to throw out one of the priests that would just buff you otherwise and focus on one more damage dealer in a team. Definitely a really solid pick especially if you run neutral/evil teams.</p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/details/Arboris/#adventurer-pull-plans","title":"Adventurer Pull Plans","text":"TheAxolotl's Pull Plan <p>Arboris was a pass for me.

She is also a hybrid between a Fighter and a Mage, and compared to Iarumas, she actually has a better all around passive set. Having both Way of the Warrior and Way of the Mage means she has both a solid scaling damage multiplier, as well as a solid MP passive MP reduction for some of her spells. While Iarumas primarily focuses on being a versatile damage dealer, Berkanan's ideal role is, in my opinion, as a weaker fighter with debuff versatility.</p> <p>Coin of Power allows her to equip one-handed and two-handed swords, which pretty much cements her as a front line adventurer. In addition, it increases physical-oriented stats.</p> <p>True Words of Fire is a very unique spell. At a glance, it's HALITO that can apply two debuffs. Both of these debuffs will stack with other sources of the same debuff, but you'll want to keep in mind the debuff limit. This spell is going to take two of the three spots. One big unknown at this time is how exactly the level-based damage of this spell works. It will presumably hit harder than HALITO, but it's too soon to say how much harder, and will be something to keep an eye on. The formula for it appears to consider both Magic Power and Class Level when calculating its damage, but it's unclear if that class level component will continue to grow as levels increase past 60, or if that portion is based on a percentage of the current maximum level. One important thing to note is that True Words of Fire, like TZALIK, has an increased sure hit rate, but we also do not know if that is intentional.</p> <p>Comparing her to Iarumas, I personally think her kit is a bit more cohesive and specialized. Iarumas has a better single target nuke, but Berkanan won't suffer from the same longevity issues and the fact that she gets access to Immortal Strike gives her a self-healing ability that deals damage, which is something mages lack. Unfortunately, Way of the Warrior will not boost Berkanan's True Words of Fire spell (or any spells for that matter) - it only applies to her physical damage, and she's lacking access to Full Power Strike. As such, she'll need to rely on Wild Strike and Heavy Attack as her main sources of physical damage.</p> <p>An important thing to note is that while Berkanan has an arguably simpler to use kit and easier to understand role than Iarumas, she does not get any skills or spells outside of True Words of Fire until level 20. This means that she's beginner-friendly in her simplicity, but she is not beginner friendly to use for brand new players, as they will be left with just basic attacks and True Words until after the first Grade Exam.</p> <p>Like Iarumas, gearing her might be a bit funky as she might want Magic Power if you want to keep True Words of Fire as a potential damage source (assuming it considers class level and Magic Power, not just the former), but she'll also want Attack Power for other skills and basic attacks in her physical kit. Unlike Iarumas, there's no question of how to fit her in on your team. Stick her in front and give her a sword.</p> Frobro's Analysis <p>At present, I\u2019m not a fan of these phys/mag hybrid units. In practice, they are middling fighters who lack Full Power Strike, have gear restrictions and effectively learn their mage spell tree without needing to class change. I think it\u2019s pretty telling that the unit that\u2019d be the best at this kind of setup, MC, doesn\u2019t get built like this because there are better ways to build him. I do not expect this unit to ever get a 2nd class.</p> <p>Onto the specifics. Coin of Power solidifies her as a front liner, which is for the best since she is incompatible with all the evil back liners who want to spread their alignment buffs. Her discipline skill is proof that there is no justice in this world. Drecom knows what it takes to make a good focus and chooses not to for many units. True Words of Fire is Halito but cooler; gets much stronger when cast at higher levels.

She can deal strong damage for a thief, particularly later on when you have both Hiding and Sneak Attack unlocked. Her skills also allow her to regularly use Precision Strike to kill enemies for a net 0 SP use. When fighting bosses, her debuffs can be very helpful, with an extra nod to Delay Attack.</p> <p>That being said, it's very likely that other thieves might be released in the future that end up providing more damage or utility than she does. Her SP restoration becomes less crucial as she gets higher up in levels, as well, due to the high SP pool that Thieves have. She's extremely helpful to have now, but it's hard to say if she'll remain strong in the future.</p> <p>If you inherit her skill to other Adventurers, the restore amount will be cut in half, with skill level 1 returning 2 SP instead of 4.</p> <p>Debra's second style is here and boy is she okay. Setting aside the appearance factor, which is going to make every degen playing this game pull for her, the Golden Maiden style is a very minor upgrade in damage dealing potential to an adventurer that is rarely used for damage dealing.</p> <p>Golden Maiden Debra is focused on having very high surety, which is great until it isn't. Most of the hardest fights, where you'd want to see sure hits, have extremely high sure evasion values, which makes Debra's gains less impactful. In addition, her emphasis is on the 1h + Shield combination which is a weird mix given the recent 2h changes that push 2h (including bows) into the upper echelons of damage dealing potential.</p> <p>Looking at her skills, Dance of the Bold Advance gives her an unknown boost to Surety, Sure Damage, and Evasion while in battle. I suspect it's relatively minor, similar to all other passives like this, but hard to say for sure. It's certainly not a bad passive.</p> <p>Her new active, Mirage Hunting, is similarly okay. Early testing indicates that when it lands a sure hit, it's comparable in damage to Heavy Attack at the same skill level, but when it's not a sure hit, Heavy Attack deals more. This effectively makes it useless as an inherit to others due to the ~35-40% drop in effectiveness of active skills, which inherited Heavy Attack does not have.</p> <p>Her Discipline, Dancer of Liberation, boosts Surety, so it's already a non-garbage Discipline, and since it also boosts evasion, it's solidly synergistic with Mirage Hunting, effectively giving the skill a second minor surety boost. As with all other Discipline skills, though, it's a very low value per dupe, so keep that in mind.</p> <p>If you use Debra, her Golden Maiden form is a damage upgrade over her standard form, as long as you're using daggers or swords. The bigger question is whether or not she's worth a valuable first row slot in your party, and that's much more up in the air. She certainly won't compete with other heavy damage dealers such as Fighters and Samurai. We're also very close to the anniversary, so this banner is pretty much a big bait banner that many folks will be pulling on.</p> Frobro's Analysis StandardGolden Maiden <p>Talk about suffering from success. An inherit so desirable that people prefer to give it to other units rather than build it up on the unit who gets the most potency out of it. Debra is a more damage-oriented thief than her peers not unlike how Adam is with mages. Her Skull Study reduces, the cost of \u201cthief spells/skills that cost 3-10 MP/SP\u201d and when coupled with Blessing of the Beastfolk God, she can use Precision Strike as a replacement for her basic attack extremely early in the game. At those early sections of the game, that +30 surety from Precision Strike is outrageous. </p> <p>As a side note, Precision Strike is in the daily shop rotation, which makes it a surprisingly easy skill to level up for being a premium skill with no inheritor. Another idea is to inherit heavy attack instead as she can still more freely use it with her high SP pool and SP regen. While on the subject, her high dexterity makes her a good candidate for inheriting high levels of Armor Break which will also synergize with Cunning Pursuit for even more damage. Who cares about the discipline, when you can level up the inherit on anyone?</p> <p>Plus she\u2019s neutral aligned which lets her be compatible in the front row with Lana as a dodge tank with her high evasion, or as a bow user in the back with Alice. She is held back by her 2nd class being knight. I wonder what the people would think about her if it were fighter instead\u2026</p> <p>Aka, Debra 2. As a stand-alone unit, she\u2019s on par with the other premium thieves like Aldric, Arboris, Rinne, and Savia, which is basically normal thief utility with some extra spice on top. The \u201cspice\u201d normally comes in the form of an attack that can shore up the thief class\u2019s weaker damage output relative to fighter/samurai. In that regard, Golden Maiden is no different. Mirage Hunting is the attack that\u2019s better than Precision Strike 3 that Debra needed, though you may need to level the skill to 3 before you can really feel it. But what\u2019s not to like; it grants bonus surety rate/damage that scales of evasion! With enough surety and this skill, you can reliably get sure hits on enemies that the devs didn\u2019t intend us to!</p> <p>The Discipline is better than base Debra\u2019s being Surety &amp; Evasion focused, but I can\u2019t help but feel like the unique passive is worse. Ever since the 2-hand weapon rework, 1-handers that aren\u2019t exceptional are in the mud. You\u2019d be better served by giving her a bow, even if you are in placing her in the front row, which means he passive won\u2019t ever be activated. While not super strong, base Debra\u2019s thief skill cost reduction passive is better than nothing.</p> <p>The most interesting thing about this new Debra is that she gets full potency on both of her inherits at the same time! Full SP regen + Full strength Mirage Hunting, no matter what style she is currently in! Plus, if your merged Debra is D1 in both styles, you can use Base Debra to discipline the Golden Debra Discipline since they share levels. If you get 1, merge it with base Debra.</p> Karkarov's Analysis StandardGolden Maiden <p>I really like giving the melee / physical dps I use Debra inherits.  Debra herself?  Her alignment lets her work in a lot of dispatches, so that's cool.  No seriously, she is too valuable as an inherit, and there are too many other thieves and knights in the game that are competitive with her or better.  Arboris, Bakesh, Amelia, Viviana, hell even Jean, or if he ever gets a re-run the my opinion best thief in the game Aldric.  Knight wise there is Balbadus, Savia, El Dorado, Ekhart, or you know.... alt class Elise????</p> <p>Her discipline is mediocre (+attack, and + paralysis resistance), her non inheritable skill is just bad (-sp cost on 3-10 sp thief skills), she is fine as a thief party member if you are new and happen to pull her I suppose. However, long term, there are just better choices, and her inherit is too valuable on other characters.  Her class combo of thief / knight is also not doing her any favors.  Go with thief / fighter \"IM PHILIP!!!!\" over Debra even, and no I can't believe I actually typed that.</p> <p>Well this is new, the alt skin is so much a different character you don't even recruit her with the name Debra.  Well I clearly wasn't impressed with Debra herself over than as an inherit fodder for other melee/physical attackers.  How will the Gold Maiden fair?  Spoiler: not much better.</p> <p>So Mirage Hunting reads really cool and on paper looks great, but in actual practice it is simply very very bad.  On a level vs level basis it will just edge out and beat Heavy Attack, but it will also cost much more SP than Heavy Attack of the same level.  If you perform a Heavy Attack level attack that is still close to the same SP cost of your Mirage Hunting level but just slightly less SP how does it go?  Well.... Heavy attack just does slightly more damage for slightly less sp.  Yes, even if you don't inherit it and use Mirage on Gold Maiden herself.  How does it perform on inherit?  Yeah, don't do that, it is absolutely garbage.  As an inherit it loses to preceision strike, nuff said.  This sounds great on paper as I said, but in real use it is just bad heavy attack.  All the gimmicks of evasion contributing to surety damage etc simply dont add enough on the low base damage to make a meaningful difference.</p> <p>What about the new uninheritable unique skill?  Well it requires Gold Maiden be in the front row.... that's bad unless she is a knight really but ok.  Oh and you have to use a one hand weapon and a shield.... so the sub optimal dps choice for a knight.  Sweet.  Simply put this skill is what I am calling a \"Gerard Tier\" skill.  Doing what you need to do to activate it results in a worse set up than just ignoring it does.  If you really use this character it either needs to be back row thief with bow, or front row knight with a two hander to help on dps.  Both of those choices nullify this skill.  Normal Debra's uninheritable skill is bad, but at least it does \"something\".</p> <p>There is one single glimmer of home though if I am being honest.  She legitimately has a good discipline, Surety and Evasion boosted.  This is a straight improvement over normal Debra, and helps her hit the surety she will need a lot easier at higher discipline levels.  So yeah, this is actually a nice uplift for the character if you can burn resources to build the discipline.</p> <p>Also despite the bedazzling, new name, and new skills all around.... she is still thief / knight.  This is just not a great class combo and there is no way around it.  Is she better than standard Debra?  Yes, Gold Maiden is absolutely better than normal Debra. Is she better than a leveled fighter / thief Benjamin with discipline?  No, not really.  Even though this is an improvement on the character, and she is going by a new name, she is still just Debra at the end of the day.</p> Shiro's Analysis StandardGolden Maiden <p>Starting with her inheritance she gives you the ability for a better SP economy. Which\u2026 similar to Adam is more a problem for her than a bonus. Because inheriting her physical characters make it easier for you, leading to less interest in raising Debra herself. Still, her inheritance is amazing and it\u2019s definitely shining in earlier parts of the game and in castle ruins.</p> <p>Moving to her passive. Again similar to Adam it\u2019s limited up to 10 cost abilities. Why? I wish to know. So similar to Adam it\u2019ll show value in the first and second abyss and fall in the third one. </p> <p>Going to her discipline allows you to build paralysis tolerance\u2026 which is niche at best for now. Unless we won\u2019t get more annoying enemies with it in future it\u2019s not really worth consideration as for now.</p> <p>Her class change is knight which is IMO upgrade over her thief class. Not only her SP regen is more impactful there thanks to lower SP pool on knights but she\u2019s also having access to better weapons and more armor pieces making her easier to build. On top of that she\u2019ll have less survivability issues letting her to be picked against some dark bosses with light weapons and Madam for optimizing her damage potential.</p> <p>To sum it up\u2026 it\u2019s really short analysis but there\u2019s just not much to talk about. Her main selling point is her inheritance and ability to make abyss one and two easier for people in early game, with Old Castle on top of it\u2026 but that\u2019s pretty much all. She's a standard banner and she\u2019s great at doing what standard banners characters should do - making game easier for newbies.</p> <p>As soon as she dropped I was amazed reading how much text her passive and inheritance had. Which turned out to be effective bait\u2026</p> <p>Starting with inheritance. It\u2019s not worth using it on other characters. It works good on Debra especially if you hit lvl 3+ on it and you have somewhat descend evasion (200+ with bow). From my personal experience using Mirage Hunting works better when she uses it as a knight and would be really great if she had access to fighters to balance out STR and evasion even more\u2026 but it\u2019s what it\u2019s</p> <p>Moving on her passive. It barely helps from what I\u2019ve noticed. A lot of text with minimal effects. As a thief you\u2019re better to go bow on frontline with her than shield+sword/dagger, and as a knight you have even better 2h weapon access. I don\u2019t need to say much more there. And no, even when I tested it with +60 evasion shield with a really good Sword of Promise it doesn't even come close to covering the difference with sword vs bow (at least on lvl 1 Mirage).</p> <p>Her discipline is actually amazing and it\u2019s one of those rare cases where it\u2019s worth investing. Mostly thanks to how strong SUR disciplines are compared to rest. </p> <p>To sum it up. If you like using Debra and you want to use her go ahead and pull. Get her Mirage Hunting on at least lvl 3 and then you can think about raising her discipline on higher levels. Or just focus on getting lvl 7 Mirage Hunting while using regular Debra for upgrading her discipline. Anyway she's a solid option for a thief and she\u2019s on the better end of them. Just turned out to be more impressive by sole descriptions rather than in practice. She\u2019s also performing better as a knight than a thief\u2026 so go ahead and grab her book if you\u2019re using her. Thanks to the latest auto battle changes she\u2019s our auto queen now allowing all the skills up to 13 SP to be cast for free (as long as you have her inheritance maxed out).</p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/details/Debra/#adventurer-pull-plans","title":"Adventurer Pull Plans","text":"TheAxolotl's Pull Plan <p>I might snag a copy just for the merge, but in general, I'd rather save for the anniversary.

Let's jump in!</p> <p>First, Tyrant's Gravity is...probably a waste of a skill slot. The initial \"taunt\" (Attract-hit style) isn't bad, but it's limited by the fact that it only lasts 3 hits and is not guaranteed. Initial reports put it as \"better than Attract Hit\" but it's hard to measure how much. If you're fighting a single difficult enemy, this has the potential to last for 3 turns, but in other fights, it could be gone in half a turn, so keep that in mind. Not bad. Not great. Doesn't hurt anything. Hard to say if it'll really help much.</p> <p>Raging King is very interesting. This skills has a unique charge-up mechanic that actually changes the skill name per hit received in a turn from Raging Skill I through Raging Skill V and into Raging Skill Fury (6 total power levels) every time he gets attacked within a turn. The skill then resets itself on his next turn, whether or not he uses the skill. The key thing to note here is that in order to benefit from the charge up, he essentially needs to always be alternating turns with the enemies. If the turn order ever goes <code>enemies -&gt; Galb -&gt; Galb -&gt; enemies</code>, the second Galb will not have any chance to get boosted damage. You could have some very interesting skill combinations here, particularly if you inherit Wild Strike to him. A scenario where you have the turn order shift from <code>Galb -&gt; Enemies</code> to <code>Enemies -&gt; Galb</code>, could result in extra charging for his attack. With Wild Strike being used to slow himself down, you could end up in a <code>Galb -&gt; Enemies -&gt; Enemies -&gt; Galb</code> situation for additional chances to charge. Conversely, you really don't ever want to PORTO him unless you're okay with an additional turn of a no guaranteed charging.</p> <p>As far as damage goes, it's hard to measure the effectiveness of active skills, but initial testing shows an inherited Raging King I to be between Heavy Attack 2 and 3 - essentially inherited Raging King = Heavy Attack at the same SP level. When kept on him, it will be ~35-40% stronger, which is quite substantial.</p> <p>One other important thing to note is that Raging King is currently locked at melee (1 row ahead) range. It does not follow weapon range, so this largely rules Galb out as a back-row adventurer. Keep this range in mind if you are using him or inheriting his skill. We are not sure if this is intended behavior or not.</p> <p>The odd part about this is his base class of Knight, which makes you want to treat him as a defensive adventurer. Don't! That's not his role. Instead, treat him like a damage dealer as you would Shiou or Fighter Lana. On turn one, use any skill - it doesn't matter too much - it could be an inherited buff such as Warrior's Battle Cry (or even better, Lingering Blossom, if you have a spare Shiou) or it could be something from his own kit like Attract Hit or Knight's Defense. From turn 2 and on, just spam Raging King until things are dead or you have no more SP.</p> <p>A few additional things to keep in mind.</p> <ul> <li>Depending on the fight you're in, it's very possible that Raging King will stay at I or II the entire fight. Some fights might let it climb up to Fury level, but the fewer collective hits coming his way, the less charging up he's able to do.</li> <li>Similarly, if he's protected will, in a fight like Emergency Occurrence, you can expect to see his skill be charged up fairly high every turn, so expect high levels of damage when he's at risk of getting hit multiple times.</li> <li>Knights typically don't have the greatest SP pools. This is somewhat offset by the lower skill cost, but something to keep in mind.</li> </ul> <p>For those that like Discipline, Bestial Roar is pretty solid - what's not to like about Attack Power and HP?</p> <p>In general, Galbadus is a fairly future-proof adventurer. The charge-up mechanic of his active skill isn't likely to be powercrept by future skills, and most future class options will enhance his combat abilities. Since you'd want to treat him as a damage dealer, his place in your party would be comparable to that of a Fighter or Samurai. Comparing him to Fighter Lana, he gains more personal damage but loses out on the end of battle heal and the row-level ~8% damage boost. Comparing him to Shiou, he gains more survivability and isn't quite as high risk. His damage level for the average player likely falls somewhere between the two, and it rivals and can potentially surpass Shiou if he's using a Cuisinart with the equipment available at the time of his release. Also, he looks pretty bad-ass.</p> <p>When deciding to pull, the biggest question you want to ask yourself is if you have room in your party for him. If you're already running a party consisting of Fighter Lana and Shiou, you probably don't need him. If you've missed out on Shiou, he could be an excellent high single target damage substitute.</p> Frobro's Analysis <p>What a cool-looking guy for such a straightforward game plan. Seems like a remix of Savia in a way; both are reliant on being targeted by enemies to do some of the highest damage any knight can output, but otherwise, they don\u2019t stand out too much compared to other knights.</p> <p>His discipline focus of attack/HP is fine, but a solid step down from Savia\u2019s weird double evasion focus. Raging King is cool, and it\u2019s nice that he has a button to click that isn\u2019t one of the easily inherited Heavy Attack equivalents, but you can get higher damage with fewer strings attached elsewhere. Also for some reason, they forgot to give it the \u201cweaker when inherited\u201d clause that every other legendary inherit gets. Tyrant\u2019s gravity sounds strong until you remember that taunt skills are whack, and this is a taunt skill that can\u2019t even be leveled up.</p> <p>This guy is in the wrong class on top of having a suboptimal alignment for being a front-row unit. Playing casually, he looks pretty neat, Dark resist is key when facing the Abyss 3 superbosses and when the stars align and you land that Raging Fury 6; I bet he feels like \u201cthat guy\u201d, but outside of the vacuum, he\u2019s just\u2026suboptimal. Still strong though.</p> Karkarov's Analysis <p>Ok it is time to do an analysis of Savi.... oh wait this is a different dark element, knight, evil, beastfolk, legendary... huh.  So if there was something we did not need it was another knight legendary with the exact same alignment, element, and race as another knight legendary.  Meanwhile they chose to go ham on the design and create a legitimately beastly bad ass cool character.  (pun intended)</p> <p>Unfortunately his appearance is also the best thing about him.</p> <p>I won't go into it but from a \"meta\" perspective the use for knights is superbosses to control aggro and use knights defense.  Galbadus is no better in this role than any other knight honestly.  His passive skill to draw three hits at the start of combat free is nice... but it is just three hits.  Meanwhile his inheritable skill Raging King is actually good... but I don't recall people bringing knights in their party for damage.  As a skill Raging King costs more SP than the equivalent level Heavy Attack, but can do a little more damage than same level Heavy Attack as well.  If Galbadus gets attacked in the round before using the skill this makes it even better than Heavy Attack as it's damage gets buffed.</p> <p>The problem is this means you need him to get attacked, which after those first three hits need taunt moves, and once again knights aren't there to attack.  Also the damage is a little better than Heavy Attack, but it is no Bamboo Splitter, and may not even be on par with Torso Strike.  It's a better heavy attack that's harder to level.</p> <p>Insult to injury, he does not play nicely with either the Elise or Lana synergy damage buffs due to his alignment.  So the best thing about him (a damage skill) only works with one of the three best formation synergy skills for damage.  You could argue using the Milana synergy here, but again, who does Milana not work with.... Lana.  So he is not compatible with the best front row damage buff, as a knight kind of works better in the back anyway, but his key skill is for dps which doesn't synergize well with knight in general.</p> <p>Discipline wise it is ... ok.  Greatly boosted HP and Attack Power.  Not terrible, not top tier either.  Not much to say here, it could have been worse for sure.</p> <p>With the unique skills he has Drecom should have made him a fighter.  As a fighter it would have been somewhat dicey due to the formation issues, but there would have been room to make him work and recommend him.  As he stands now I can't say he is any better for knight Superboss duty than El Dorado who isn't even a legend, or Savia.  In fact they are probably better due to their additional buffs from class swaps.  This guys entire value rides on what alt class he gets in who knows how long from now.  If it is fighter, post class swap, we are looking at a character that may be worth serious consideration.  As he stands now.... his best use is as a skill inherit on a fighter to replace heavy attack. Of course it doesn't help that for abyss three and beyond duty you will need to level Raging King to level three or higher to maintain viability....</p> <p>Don't get me wrong.  Galbadus is not a bad character, or near the bottom of the legendary pile, but for his skill set he is the wrong class and a sub optimal alignment.</p> <p>It is critical to understand that this character as it stands now is not a \"good to go\" character.  His alt class, when it's released, will be critical to determining his long term value.  His Raging King skill is good, but it has to be leveled ideally to level 3 or higher for use in later Abyss 3 and beyond content.  This means even if you do commit to Galbadus, he is not Sheli or Shiou, one copy is not enough.  You have to pull multiple copies to level his Raging King skill, otherwise he just becomes a really cool looking knight that has a semi-useful, but not truly meaningful, unique skill.</p> Shiro's Analysis <p>Starting with his inheritance. Oh boy\u2026 it\u2019s one of the best ones in the game as for now. Especially if you run into harder fights where the enemy has multiple attacks per turn. As far as I tested his skill, it beasts damage options like FPS (for example Raging King can bring constant 4.5k DMG per turn on lvl 3 compared to FPS doing 8k only on much higher attack) or DTS as soon as you grab a few attacks in your direction. And this will also be his main selling point. It\u2019s strong enough to a point where it\u2019s worth inheriting it to other characters because even in the worst case scenario where the enemy doesn\u2019t attack it\u2019s as good as Heavy Attack at very least.</p> <p>Moving on his passive.. it\u2019s good for auto farming when you run Morgus buff to make it more stable and lessen rng in fight\u2026 or take less rng in some fights with bosses in first turns (especially good if you want to have specific focus on single target bosses like 0C GWO) but outside it\u2026 it\u2019s lacking. It\u2019s only 3 attacks long.</p> <p>Moving to his discipline we don\u2019t have anything special there. It\u2019s focused on HP+ATK. It\u2019s something but not much. Not worth the focus IMO (unless you rate 8 more ATK and 24 more HP on LVL 9 discipline that much).</p> <p>As for class change he doesn't have any as for now but I do hope he\u2019ll get a fighter.</p> <p>To sum it up\u2026 when Galba arrived and I saw his kit I was honestly disappointed\u2026 he had great design but his kit felt lacking\u2026 that was until I pulled and used him. His active skill is completely absurd with how cheap the dmg tradeoff is. On top of it I thought that he\u2019s bad because he's a knight not a fighter\u2026 but in practice it turned out that access to cover ability (especially passive like behind cover) allows him to stack his skill really easily making him the best knight with DPT potential next to Livana. Still\u2026 he needs a fighter for counter/follow up attack/Way of the Warrior/Immortal Strike/Wild Strike which will cover his kit even more. As for now I\u2019m unsure whether it\u2019s better to run him as a knight for easier stacking of his active skill or pray that he\u2019ll get a fighter and run him as one. Either way Galbadus turned to be not only an amazing visually designed character but an all over solid damage dealing knight. With only downgrade being that his skill is always melee locked. Great addon to your team and completely worth running an evil team with him over bothering yourself with Lana buff.</p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/details/Galbadus/#adventurer-pull-plans","title":"Adventurer Pull Plans","text":"TheAxolotl's Pull Plan <p>While his active skill seems fun and is potentially very powerful, I don't know that I'd necessarily have a place for him in my party, so I'm likely going to skip.</p> Karkarov's Pull Plan <p>I can't suggest you pull this character.</p> <p>Ironically his shield is actually a good piece of gacha gear that works fantastic because it procs taunt on attacking (this includes SP based skills), pair that with his skill Raging King and you are cooking.

He's not a bad legendary by any means, but many of his initial advantages have been relegated to less impactful now that we have new adventurers and skills available to us.

Unfortunately, with the addition of Full Power Strike to the Fighter arsenal, even if class changing Gerard to Fighter, his signature skill becomes a conditional attack at best.

Another key thing to note is that he is a Dark type adventurer with a Air type skill, which means he misses out on a same-type damage multiplier when hitting weaknesses, which is unfortunate.</p> <p>Lightning Celerity is fine - it's a passive personal evasion increase, however it's a static increase and not a percentage, so it will lose value as stats increase.</p> <p>Gerard's biggest disadvantage is that he is designed to do damage, but his signature skills don't contribute much in the way towards dealing most of his damage.

This likely won't be a permanent limitation, though, since in the future we should be able to build a strong Neutral/Evil front row.</p> <p>You can get around this by putting him in the back row with a spear, but that will limit the effectiveness of Eruption Strike.</p> <p>One other thing going against him is that the Port Town Grand Legion is full of water enemies, including the bosses, which will increase the damage he takes and reduce his Eruption Strike damage unless you inherit Adam to him.</p> <p>With the release of Rinne, Gerulf finally gets some solid Evil support from her Surety buff, which is a welcome addition to Evil teams!</p> Frobro's Analysis <p>This guy is a Min/Max stat gremlin with an uninspired kit. Aside from his discipline (Attack + Surety), there isn\u2019t anything worth writing home about. That accuracy boost when using a 2 handed weapon is a joke. Why not accuracy, surety and attack; at least something comparable to the blessings he can get from a shield! Might as well pretend he doesn't have a unique passive.</p> <p>As for Eruption Strike, it\u2019s basically Heavy Attack 3 but red and you gotta use a 2-handed hammer. Even if you use Gerulf in your party, you\u2019re still gonna use Full Power Strike over this. An inherit skill so bad that even the owner doesn\u2019t use it, wow. Beyond that, an evil front liner ruins the feng shui for many players, which makes his whole thing a no-go. Honestly, is this guy really any better than Benjamin?</p> Shiro's Analysis <p>Starting with his inheritance that was meme back in the days after 2h changes it started to hit as hard as DTS (when inherited on others - on Gerulf it\u2019s even better option) which is a huge upgrade. The issue being that you need a 2h hammer for it. For himself with a 2h hammer? It's a great damage skill that will ditch out really high DMG and it\u2019s nothing to laugh about anymore. Might synergize well with picks like Amelia/Chloe/Lana/Raffaello and shine strong if we\u2019ll get wind theme abyss. As for now it's a solid option but it\u2019s not as useful as Livena\u2019s skill.</p> <p>Moving to his passive. He doesn\u2019t have one. I mean\u2026 it\u2019s there. But it could as well not be there and no one would see the difference.</p> <p>Moving to his discipline. He\u2019s got one among the best for pure unga bunga purposes. SUR focused discipline is always a good choice to rise especially if you\u2019ll want to max out and use your Gerulf. And it\u2019ll be his best possible choice unless his future alternative version won\u2019t bring something like double SUR focus or SP+SUR.</p> <p>His class change is priest. Which is a great choice for an evil party with an additional setup of buffs or cleanse if you don\u2019t run Arboris. Otherwise it\u2019s a bit of wasted potential for possible thief passives for SUR damage or knight for even more survivability.</p> <p>To sum it up. When it comes to unga bunga, Gerulf is your best choice and he\u2019ll do it better than any other fighter. Definitely worth dropping the idea of going crazy over Lana passive and using him if you like him. The only issue is that he\u2019ll be sitting on your front row with a 2h hammer to bring most of his potential. So if you\u2019re using for example Galba that are already 2 front slots taken. His Eruption Strike is doing great damage now, his setup (fire, male, dwarf) is perfect for fighters that benefit greatly from STR and DEX with only demerit - low SPD. His discipline is great. He\u2019s simple but he does what he\u2019s supposed to do the best - using a hammer for crowd control. After all there\u2019s no better crowd control than death.</p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/details/Gerulf/#duplicate-usage","title":"Duplicate Usage","text":"<ul> <li>Inherit on his own skill will increase the damage and cost of his Eruption Strike.</li> <li>Once his Eruption Strike is maxed out, increase his Discipline to increase his damage further.</li> <li>Save for future use or dismiss for Grade tags.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/details/Gillion/","title":"Details","text":""},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/details/Gillion/#gillion","title":"Gillion","text":"<p>Race: Human Gender: Male Type: Neutral Personality: Evil Starting Class: Fighter Class Change:  Role: Damage  </p> Portraits Fighter <p></p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/details/Gillion/#skills","title":"Skills","text":"<p>Unique Skill (Inheritable)</p> Cry of Ruin <p>Moderate dark-type close-range physical attack with high Accuracy on 1 enemy.

Read on if you're interested in specifics, but for those that just want some advice on whether or not to pull without knowing the why, I recommend skipping.</p> <p>First off, we'll talk about the easy one - his passive, Cursed-Blood Resonance, provides accuracy, action speed, and approximately a 10% damage increase at the cost of a loss of 5% of his maximum HP. Note that if he's below 5% of his maximum, this passive can kill him.</p> <p>Now, his active skill is much more interesting. Cry of Ruin has a lot going on. First, it's a medium attack that is a Dark type physical attack, which makes it subject to damage reduction when fighting Undead. Second, this attack is locked in to close range, regardless of the range of the equipped weapon, and is a single hit, so you absolutely do not want to be using it with a 1h sword or dagger. Third, the self damage costs 25% of his maximum HP (35% when inherited to someone else) and is additive with Cursed-Blood Resonance. This means he takes recoil damage equal to 30% of his maximum HP when he uses this skill and can absolutely kill himself with it. This damage is applied after any end-of-attack or enemy kill heals, but prior to an end-of-battle heal, such as Lana's passive HP restore.</p> <p>On to the weird stuff - the splash damage of his attack is very unique because it is based off the actual enemy formation and positioning. We don't have any real insight into those mechanics, but in general, this splash damage takes the damage dealt to the primary target and deals 35%, plus or minus X, of that damage to adjacent enemies. This splash damage is considered \"true\" damage, as it is based solely on the initial damage dealt (including factors like Slayer/Type weapons, Surety, and other damage boosts). If there are any targets adjacent to those receiving splash damage, they get hit with 35% of the splash damage.</p> <p>As an example, suppose you deal 3000 damage to target A in this enemy formation, this illustration shows the magnitude of damage that targets B and C would receive:</p> <pre><code>A (3000) - B (1050) - C (368)\n</code></pre> <p>When fighting undead, this splash damage will appear to be reduced further in the text display, however the numeric value is still calculated at the 35% as expected.</p> <p>Earlier, I mentioned the \"plus or minus X.\" This is where things get really weird. Enemy positions and formations are somewhat variable, so while 35% is pretty constant for most enemy formations, you'll occasionally encounter formations where enemies are slightly closer together or slightly further apart. These variances actually impact the splash damage, so against some enemy formations, you might see splash damage closer to 45% or 55% of the original damage, while in others, you might see splash damage closer to 15% or 25% of the original damage. Annoying, right?</p> <p>His Discipline is fine - it's attack power and accuracy.</p> <p>So, what does all this mean? Well, this is our third damage dealing legendary recently that follows the high risk, high reward approach after Shiou and Galbadus, with the caveat that he's probably the highest risk for the lowest reward. If you plan to use his active skill, you effectively have to treat him as having 30% less effective HP, which can be very detrimental in some fights. While his attack is our first true physical row attack (Rinne's MoF targets the enemy's MDEF instead of DEF), the nature of the splash damage makes it not very well suited for acting as a row damage attack. If you're using it to farm, you'll constantly have to be restoring his HP between fights. If you're using it for progression, many of the encounters where you might want to deal large levels of row damage against difficult enemies (certain Emergency Occurrence strategies, for example), have enough enemies that lowering Gillion's effective HP is a bad idea.</p> <p>There are some unique positives to this skill, though. The first is that the splash damage being true damage could be helpful to chip away at any future encounters were we might have enemies that are largely immune to physical damage (depending completely on what those enemy formations might be). Similarly, there could be future encounters where there is shared damage across targets, and the splash damage would let you essentially double-dip by dealing regular and splash damage to the shared HP pool. The second is that if you inherit his skill to the MC, you give the MC a very easy way to force a flame if an encounter starts going poorly.</p> <p>These use cases are far and few between, though. I wouldn't go as far as saying Gillion is a bad adventure. He's essentially Wizardry's version of Dark Knight Cecil from Final Fantasy, and Cecil is awesome. I love the idea of the Dark Knight mechanics, but unfortunately, they don't lend themselves well to the mechanics in this game, and he's definitely a risky adventurer to use for very little unique gain.</p> Karkarov's Analysis <p>First off I have to hand it to Drecom, from a visual design perspective they have been hitting home runs effectively every new character since Galbadus, and Gillion is no exception.  If you are a dark fantasy fan, or love yourself some Dark Souls like I do, there is a lot to visually like about how this character is designed and created.  He even has cool specific graphical and audio flair that is new to the game, IE in combat he wears a full face helmet, but post combat in some animations you actually see him take the helmet off, and when he speaks with it on vs off his voice will sound normal or muffled based on if he is wearing it.  I personally really appreciate these design details and the work Drecom is doing here, they could be brain dead like every other Gacha and just making \"hot woman #5 with cat tail and ears, make the butt bigger this time\" but they are actally being creative instead.</p> <p>That said what about his mechanical performance?  Well.... I can tell the visual and mechanical designers are probably not the same person...  Typically when a new Inheritable Attack Skill (especially one as complex as this) is introduced I try to write some kind of analysis and detail of it's function.  In this case I am not going to go into those details as Axolotl has already covered it exteremely well in his analysis.  So if you want the critical mechanical explanation please read his analysis he did a wonderful job on it.  Instead I am going to focus on value or lack thereof, of \"Cry of Ruin\".</p> <p>Well first off lets be real, costing 25% of the users hp (or 35% on inherit) is downright criminal for the damage it does.  If the damage were like.... double it would be worth tossing around, but it is around HA3 damage at level 1.  It is also close range only, so you can't use it from the back row at all.  On the bright side leveling it doesn't increase the hp cost so if you are insane you can level it to improve the damage without eating more damage in return.  Just know that level for level single target it also does less damage than Moonlit Axe Toss of debuffing and I can use it from any row I want.  Meanwhile it has the same sp cost and again... 25% (or more) of your hp lost for using it.  Heavy Attack starts to pass it as well single target wise past level 3 for again similar SP cost (HA 5 costs the same as Cry Cry Cry 3 but does more \"target damage\").</p> <p>Now before you stop the presses and damn this skill to the levels of Gerard and Gerulf attack skills (aka totally irrelevant and never worth using) there are SOME situations where it may be valuable.  </p> <p>For example, if you have an average or low defence enemy standing beside a nigh invulnerable massive defense enemy.  Since the splash damage is calculated only on the target damage this will deal effective damage to Mr Invulnerable.  An example of this would be the Golem Duo Superboss fight.  It is also honestly pretty effective against GWO3 by targetting his much softer tentacles, especially when the t rex armed body is buffed.  There is also one niche use as an inherit, it's a way to controllably drop Shious HP into Ephemeral / Water Formation levels while still doing ok damage, but without also putting a giant aggro target on Shiou's face which many Samurai skills do.  Lastly and quite hilariously, it does have value as a \"lets just reset\" tool.  You can use it to forcibly kill a character (yes spike damage you take for using it can kill you), then you can just intentionally fail the rez minigame to kill the MC. Boom you got a quick flame rez or \"accept death\" in a fight/run you know you aren't winning.</p> <p>Now that we have covered his crappy Emo Crybaby skill, what about the rest?  Well frankly the rest kinda makes me mad the skill is so bad.  His discipline is good, it is Accuracy and Attack Power, could have been surety but how often do I type that?  As a character his Dark element isn't the most meta stats wise but it does give him a little Luck trait kicker and is very useful defensively in many of the games hardest fights (as of 10/31/25 when this was written).  His alignment is also Neutral which is a big deal because it gives him the most versatility from a fromation buff perspective and matters alot because of the next thing...</p> <p>What about his passive uninheritable skill?  Ok upfront yes, as a result of \"Cursed Blood Resonance\" if you give him a two handed weapon (any two hand weapon) he will take 5% HP loss on attack.  Yes any attack.  Heavy attack?  Check.  Regular attack? Check.  Casting Feru with a two handed staff?  Check.  Counter attack?  Absolutely.  Perform an attack and miss?  Of course you take 5%.  Follow Up Attack?!?!?? Thankfully no, but you did a normal attack to proc it already.  Also he wont take 5% when casting buffs, debuffs, or healing spells, I checked.</p> <p>However... this is a BIG one... He gains Action Speed, Accuracy, and +10% damage when using a two hander.  Combine this with his element and alignment... you are looking at a Fighter who in exchange for 5% HP loss can run the Alice and Elise formation buff at the same time while adding his own 10% kicker.  This means Gillion can get a higher two hand damage \"just standing there\" buff than any other character in the game. Meanwhile as bad as 5% seems... is Lana in your party with her passive heal leveled?  Unless the fight goes longer than 2 rounds or Gillion actually takes real damage from the enemies the Lana heal will cover the 5%.  Then he can also use the Arboris formation buff, Red Beards too, etc etc etc.  This guy simply fits in any team comp you can imagine that isn't \"good or evil only\" and works.</p> <p>So he is potentially the best dps auto unit in the game (just put Elise behind him with a spear and Lana as always in the front row), and in actuality has real potential for manual use as a very serious DPS unit.  In my optinion the 5% sucks, but not so much it makes the passive skill bad.  It is not bad, I think it's actually great.  That said, Gillion is definitely not a new player friendly character despite being a fighter, and his inheritable attack is too niche to be called \"good\", it's kinda bad for normal play.  </p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/details/Gillion/#adventurer-pull-plans","title":"Adventurer Pull Plans","text":"TheAxolotl's Pull Plan <p>Pretty easy pass here for me. The distance based damage and recoil damage are just too unreliable for me to consider running him.</p> Karkarov's Pull Plan <p>Drecom once again was cooking something but it is an acquired taste.  I used this analogy when discussing this character with others and will again.  Gillion is just like the Jean Claude Van Damme Street Fighter movie.  It's a terrible Street Fighter movie, but if you can convince yourself it isn't about Street Fighter and the similarities are just a coincidence you can have a great Tuesday by enjoying it for what it is.  A great schlocky B Movie where Raul Julia over delivers and owns the screen.  (RIP Raul).  If you can look past Gillions extremely niche limited use inheritable attack he is actually a very strong DPS unit with incredible party comp versatility due to his class, alignment, and element combo.  His visual design is also one of the best Drecom has delivered in my opinion and dead on target for the Wizardry theme.</p> <p>For new players, or really anyone that has not cleared at least a \"good ending\" in Abyss 3 I am not sure I can tell you to pull for anything but the design.  In fact I wont, don't pull if this is you.  For players who have cleared a \"good ending\" of abyss 3, have access to all the games best farm spots, and have been playing longer and may have the inherit and party depth options... I think Gillion can be a truly be top tier DPS maybe even the best DPS fighter (as of 10/31/25 when this was written) and is worth seriously thinking about.  </p> <p>It is also worth saying it, from a Gacha Gear perspective this banner is just fire.  Every item is actually great, even the ring, and the armor and two hand sword are both the new \"best in slot\" in their respective gear catagories.

First, to mention the elephant in the room, he is not an actual Samurai despite the belief many folks had that the Samurai class would release with him. Instead, a new precedent was set where the collab adventurers were released with their own unique classes. In this case, The <code>Mage of the Black Rod</code> class is a mix between a Fighter and a Mage, gaining some interesting versatility while losing some key passive skills. Notably, Iarumas does not naturally have access to the damage multiplier provided by <code>Way of the Warrior</code>, nor does he naturally have access to the MP cost reduction provided by <code>Way of the Mage</code>. He also does not have access to the new <code>Full Power Strike</code> skill, which means he's missing the Fighter's most efficient physical damage attack. Iarumas' assortment of skills and spells makes him a unique and versatile damage dealer that can provide some additional support.</p> <p>Mage of the Black Rod is a very unique passive skill, as its function changes based on whether Iarumas is in the front row or the back row. Since a component of this skill requires being in combat, we can't see exact numbers of the stat increase and some of them are harder to calculate, but rough early math seems to indicate that this skill provides a boost of 15 Attack Power. This skill does appear to provide a static boost, which makes him hit comparatively strong with basic attacks early on, but that tapers off as he gains levels.</p> <p>His unique spell TZALIK has the potential to be extremely powerful. The fact that it deals major damage will put it above LA-spells in terms of magnitude, and its Magic Defense penetration will go ever farther to make it hit hard. The mana cost of 20 at base puts it roughly in line with a level 5 basic spell. This spell is a bit of a double edged sword, though. Like the CONES line, it's untyped which means it won't encounter any element type resistances. On the other hand, it won't deal weakness damage to anything. Furthermore, due to the lack of weakness damage, he won't be able to take advantage of the same type multiplier for having his element type match his attack's element type. One important thing to note is that this spell deals sure hits more frequently than other spells, both when Iarumas casts it and when it's inherited to another adventurer, regardless of the weapon equipped. It is unclear at this time if this is intended functionality. We know spells can sure hit, but we do not know if TZALIK is supposed to have an increased sure hit rate over other spells or not.</p> <p>Iarumas has quite a powerful kit and can fill the role of a very versatile damage dealer. Here are a few considerations in general:</p> <ul> <li>He does not have Full Power Strike, but he can gain access to Way of the Warrior through skill inheritance, which gives him a nice damage boost for his melee capabilities.</li> <li>He has the CONES line as well as TZALIK, which really emphasizes his magic damage, however his passive skill boosting stats while using 1h swords or staves puts him ideally in the front row with magic-based equipment, which is a potentially unique niche. He can exist in the back row, but that will effectively render his access to Follow-Up Attack and Counterattack irrelevant as sources of supplemental damage.</li> <li>He has Neutral typing, so he can benefit from Lanavaille, Alice, and Elise synergy buffs, as well as be relatively protected against row-switching mechanics.</li> <li>He has no Way of the Mage, so he might become MP starved in long fights. Furthermore, there is currently no easy or convenient way to regain MP while in dungeons, which could negatively impact his longevity. Hopefully this will be remedied with a future skill inherit.</li> </ul> <p>One big unknown is that we don't know if he will end up getting the Samurai class when that gets released in early Summer. We also don't know what future katanas will look like. His current role seems to be one of a front line magical damage dealer, which could be very fun and powerful, but he might have issues in longer dungeons or prolonged boss fights. Gearing him could also prove problematic since gearing for Magic Power is going to decrease his physical effectiveness, while gearing for Attack Power is going to decrease his magical effectiveness, and most of his current kit seems to support Magic Power being a focus. His lack of a heavy-hitting physical damage skill, outside of inheriting levels to Wild Strike, hinders his physical damage a bit, but not enough to render him obsolete by any means.</p> <p>Duplicate usage is also going to be unique with him. Normally, I like to prioritize inherits over discipline for duplicates, however high levels of TZALIK could result in a currently unsustainable MP cost, while discipline would give him a low amount of extra Attack Power, Magic Power, SP, and MP. On the other hand, if you're intending to use TZALIK as a situational nuke, increasing the damage it deals could be very impactful, despite the added cost.</p> <p>Iarumas is a very strong multi-purpose damage dealer with excellent Neutral and Void typing, and his kit is quite unique. You'll want to decide if his uniqueness and versatility is worth including in a party, though, as he faces some strong competition from more specialized adventurers.</p> Frobro's Analysis <p>At present, I\u2019m not a fan of these phys/mag hybrid units. In practice, they are middling fighters who lack Full Power Strike, have gear restrictions and effectively learn their mage spell tree without needing to class change. I think it\u2019s pretty telling that the unit that\u2019d be the best at this kind of setup, MC, doesn\u2019t get built like this because (unless your name is TheAxolotl) there are better ways to build him. Iarumas is getting access to samurai proper at a later date, so my mind may change.</p> <p>Judging him as he is, not bad. Drecom loaded his passives and gear with stats to ensure he could at least keep up with mages as a caster and fighters as a basic physical attacker. They did everything in their power to make him interesting. Tzalik is extremely strong and stat-creep-proof with the magic defense penetration effect and I guess the ability for it to surety is intended since they never patched it out. Being void is\u2026different, and being neutral aligned makes him splashable with most team comps.</p> Shiro's Analysis <p>Starting with his inheritance it\u2019s amazing. The only issue with it is\u2026 it wants surety\u2026 so you probably will never bring full potential from it on your mages\u2026 unless you build them around surety. Which collides with their skillset. The other issue with it is that it costs 20 MP. Less of an issue in abyss 3 but definitely an issue earlier on in the game. But if you build Iarumas as mage with 2h staff he\u2019s going to be able to burst some bulkier enemies.</p> <p>Moving to his passive. Not only is there a lot of text but there are some decent values. I\u2019m unsure if I would go with Saber over the option to run him with 2h staff as for now but it\u2019s still a great chunk of stats to make building him easier.</p> <p>Moving to his discipline. I don\u2019t have much to say there. Definitely one of the best ones we have as for now quite fitting the protagonist. A bit disappointed in no SUR in it despite TZALIK being SUR oriented skill but it\u2019s still a really good one thanks to how many stats it upgrades.</p> <p>To sum it up\u2026 Iarumas is a bit weird. His passives are more fighter-like oriented while abilities  he learns belong to a mage. His class also belongs to a mage letting him to be used in mage trials. It would be better if he had full access to fighter-mage passives but it\u2019s what it is. His spells are void type which is\u2026 quite bad. Sure you don\u2019t need to use Adam inherit to counter possible resistance but you\u2019ll also never have elemental advantage. Still, you can build him as a fighter and he works perfectly fine as one. Or you can build him like a samurai chasing as much mag and ATK as you can to run him with HA/DTS while having access to TZALIK. Overall I feel like they made Iarumas fitting his protagonist title and I do hope that he\u2019ll get access to samurai class when we get a rerun of the collaboration. After all, Iarumas without Samurai access feels kind of void. Joking aside, Iarumas is still a really solid option to use.</p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/details/Iarumas/#adventurer-pull-plans","title":"Adventurer Pull Plans","text":"TheAxolotl's Pull Plan <p>I like the Iarumas/Berkanan banner, so I pulled a decent amount on this one.

Not only does she provide defensive capabilities, her ability to buff a Good/Neutral row can be very powerful, particularly if you have a Good/Neutral MC. A front row of Lanavaille - MC - Debra/Gerard is very common at the moment, and all three units would benefit from the increased damage.</p> <p>In addition to her battle prowess, Lanavaille's end of battle heal is extremely valuable early game. While the initial heal amount is only 12, increasing the inheritance level will boost the heal value up to stay competitive as you progress throughout the game. This heal is often potent enough to allow you to save your healer's MP while grinding/farming or progressing through the story. The heal won't provide any real value during boss fights, but her damage boost will.</p> <p>If you have an evil MC, however, her value drops significantly.</p> <p>The newly fixed skills for Wandering Lanavaille are quite interesting, as they provide some nice minor buffs without fundamentally changing the character itself. The ASPD boost on Valiant Righteousness is very minimal at 2 ASPD per slot, however it only considers the weapon and chest armor slots. This means at most, you'll see a 4 ASPD boost.</p> <p>The changes to her Discipline nice - you should never say no to more HP, and Critical Tolerance will help prevent instant death, which is always good.</p> <p>Neither of these skill changes are game-breaking by any means, so if you don't like Lanavaille as an adventurer or you prefer her standard style, you won't really be missing out on anything by skipping her. If you like her, though, her Wandering Princess form is all around better than her standard form and going for a couple copies wouldn't be a bad idea at all.</p> <p>Wandering Lanavaille is the first adventurer that enables the merge option in the training room. This combines the two styles into a single adventurer and adds another passive skill that provides a very minor boost to a few stats. There is no real reason not to merge the two styles together. From there, you can choose which style you want to use.</p> <p>One key thing to note is that Discipline is tied to the particular style, so standard Lana dupes cannot be used to increase the Discipline of Wandering Princess Lana. This actually makes it an easy choice for standard dupe usage if you use Wandering Princess Lana, as inheriting standard Lana dupes to the merged Wandering Princess Lana will give the best value.</p> Frobro's Analysis Standard <p>Do I even need to explain this one? One of the few well-aligned party buffs in the game. That post-battle healing is incredibly strong. At level 1 it falls off after the early game which makes people think lowly of it, but it is great even at level 60 with just a few more levels. Assuming you use Lana, this isn\u2019t the worst use of Codexs around. I don\u2019t even bring a healer when auto-farming events anymore.</p> <p>The real kicker here is that to reach her full potential, you gotta switch Lana to fighter. (After learning all the knight stuff first) The downside is having to look at dork fighter Lana. The upside is that Wana exists. Besides looking better as a fighter, Wana also gets an ASPD boost with a gear-based conditional and turns Lana\u2019s \u201cwhatever\u201d discipline focus into \u201cwhatever\u2026but better\u201d. When merged, you only need to level the Queen of War and Love skill on one unit to apply it to both styles.</p> Shiro's Analysis StandardWandering Princess <p>Starting with inheritance. It's a really strong one for the early part of the game-mostly abyss one and two. But even when maxed out in the third abyss it feels like QoL at best and having it on her or your MC will rarely make difference in long run despite halved healing. Because either enemies don\u2019t do enough DMG and healing won\u2019t matter or they hit too hard and it\u2019s not enough. Never in the sweet spot to justify using Lana alone for it.</p> <p>Moving to her passive. It\u2019s good. Massively overrated to a point where people lose their heads saying you\u2019re not allowed to run an evil front but still good. But in practice? Unless you stack it with other % bonus passives like Madam or Elise you\u2019ll barely feel any difference in fights outside that light dopamine kick from slightly bigger numbers. Definitely not worth worrying about team comp just to run around it.</p> <p>Her discipline felt like absolute ass for a really long time till we got to the third abyss. And now it turned out to be actually a good one. Having charm/conf resistance will never go wrong and allows you to build faster immunity. Definitely worth investment after you\u2019re done maxing out her inheritance on her.</p> <p>Her class change is a fighter which is a massive upgrade to her. Once you\u2019ll get it there\u2019s no reason to go back to knight. Her lane buff starts to become more useful on her too as she\u2019ll be one of your main damage dealers with access to it.</p> <p>To sum it up. Lana is not game changing by any means but she\u2019s still a great solid pick. If you\u2019re running an evil team, kick her out or use her in the backlane for some auto farming setups with Abenius, Debra or whoever else you might use in the back as a neutral/good damage dealer. It was nice to have \u201cLana meta\u201d back in the days when we didn\u2019t have that many strong evil options and when her buff somehow makes for gaps in your equipment. Otherwise? Nothing worth losing your head about or panicking that you don\u2019t have her. But hey. She\u2019s good at buffing Liviana backlane damage.</p> <p>She gets some bonus ASPD from 1h sword, light armor and slightly more bulk on discipline. Nothing to write there over it. It's an upgrade especially for speed tuning but that\u2019s all.</p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/details/Lanavaille/#adventurer-pull-plans","title":"Adventurer Pull Plans","text":"TheAxolotl's Pull Plan <p>I pulled for a couple copies of Wandering Lana.

As a big fan of 2h weapons in general, I've been exited about the idea of a 2h-focused Fighter since the game came out, and...this one is not what I had in mind at all.</p> <p>First, as a passive, <code>The One Who Enforces</code> is somewhat decent. Surety and Accuracy are two solid stats to increase for 2h axe usage, and the increase itself is a flat +7 of each. This is roughly equivalent to the gains of a Discipline 2 featured stat, being somewhat higher than Discipline 2 but not quite to the same value of Discipline 3.</p> <p>And while I'm mentioning Discipline, <code>Bloodline of the Mirror-Mere</code> is not that great. Accuracy is fine, but Magic Defense is lackluster, and neither are really worth focusing on. Discipline her if you want, but just remember that the gain per duplicate value is low.</p> <p>Her <code>Moonlit Pool of the White Daemon</code> is a fantastic skill. I'm not a huge fan of active skills as the signature skill on a damage-dealing adventurer in general since we never know what future skill could come along to render a signature skill largely irrelevant (I'm looking at you, Gerard), but I'm not quite as bothered by it in this case. This is mainly because her signature skill isn't going to be your main focus for dealing damage - instead, it'll be a situational utility attack. Being a moderate attack, the damage should be comparable to Gerulf's Eruption Strike and Gerard's Thunderstrike. As a water attack, it will also deal type-effective damage on par with Gerulf and stronger than Gerard due to Livana herself also being a water type. Just remember to inherit in Adam if you plan to use her to fight earth type enemies. In addition to ignoring range, this skill can apply Spell-Binding and is our first debuff focused on reducing an enemy's Magic Power.</p> <p><code>Moonlit Pool of the White Daemon</code> will ultimately allow you to treat her 2h axe (or whatever weapon, but if you're running her, you should be using a 2h axe) as a Bow and hit at any range. There is one big limitation with this skill, though - it is a forced single hit attack, which means if you're using her with a dagger or sword and a shield, she will still only deal one attack with it. That's pretty much a non-issue if you're using a 2h axe, but it's something to keep in mind, particularly if you want to inherit this skill to someone else. Unfortunately, this skill also does not seem to gain the damage increase that <code>Way of the Warrior</code> provides, likely due to it not being considered dealing close-range damage.</p> <p>One potential use case of inheriting <code>Moonlit Pool of the White Daemon</code> to a non-Livana adventurer would be to give it to a back-row adventurer (such as a mage, priest, knight, or thief) using the Staff of Weakness. Since this is a skill and not a spell, it would allow the adventurer to apply the Staff of Weakness debuff from the back row without an accuracy loss. Likely not the best action for a turn in most cases, but could occasionally be useful. With the latest 2h weapon changes, this becomes a substantial damage dealer even when inherited, and is widely considered a Priest's best source of single target damage.</p> <p>Also with the release of her second class as a Knight, she's arguably one of the best Legendary Knights in the game. On encounters such as 0 Corruption, superbosses, and sentries, it's practically impossible for Knight Livana to have a dead turn. Moonlit Pool allows her to deal full damage with her signature skill from the back row on turns when using Knight's Defense or Cover skills are not needed, which is a massive boon over many other Knights.</p> Frobro's Analysis <p>Full Disclosure: This unit\u2019s release prompted me to begin articulating my thoughts on how Drecom designs units with these reviews. Previously, Livana was aggressively mid. Now that 2-handed weapons got buffed with basically double damage and increased blessing values are on the way, this one needs to be re-evaluated.</p> <p>Problem 1: An awful discipline focus. Accuracy and Mag Def\u2026not Attack or Surety, even Action Speed would have been fine. Something unusual, like Luck, could have been strong to pair with Follow-up Attack. Mag Def on a premium unit\u2026What a joke!</p> <p>Problem 2: That active skill, Moonlit Pool of the White Daemon. Fighters want to use Full Power Strike when sustained damage is needed and Heavy Attack 3 when they need damage quickly. With all the data the devs have showing that skills like Thunder/Eruption Strike aren\u2019t used by players, why did they create a skill in the same vein but blue? Post-2-hand weapon buff, this skill is outrageous. It seems that the soft cap for this skill is incredibly high or nonexistent. Even when inherited, Mages/Priests with 2-hand staves can get relatively high damage from just lvl 1 of this skill (and surety). It does have some utility with ignoring the distance penalty, and the Magic Power debuff seems consistent even when inherited, but that part is less useful as there are few enemies you\u2019d really want that for. </p> <p>Problem 3: That Passive skill. +7 Accuracy and Surety when using a 2-handed axe is a joke. How did they release something like this when they already got it right with Iarumas\u2019s &amp; Berkanan\u2019s version of this? Their passives give them a boost to more than 2 stats at a potency comparable to decent blessings as if it were a shield or 2nd accessory and isn\u2019t limited to 1 weapon type. </p> <p>I anticipate this banner will be one of the worst-performing banners yet for Drecom. This is unadulterated \u201cMid\u201d; general adventurers like Elise and Benjamin are better than this. I have no idea what the devs were thinking when they came up with this; I guess they weren\u2019t. My best guess is that they are thinking ahead to what the legendary pool will look like when previous legends get mass demoted to the base pool and felt the need to dilute it with a new stinker. My bad; she\u2019s got a job now: Big Damage for 9sp.(need to use a 2-hand weapon)</p> Karkarov's Analysis <p>Livana is the poster child of \"If only Drecom changed one thing this character would be good!\"  With Livana on release two handed weapons just weren't good, and she is clearly designed to be using a two handed axe.  She needed two handed axes to be viable for her character design to work well.  As many have noticed by the time of this analysis (10/9/25), Drecom has changed the viability of two handed weapons in a big way.</p> <p>So let's get the bad out of the way first.  Livana, your discipline is ASS!!!1!111!  Ok it honestly is nowhere near as bad as people claim.  First off, you have to understand Legendaries have a higher base stat gain than non-legendaries on discipline.  A Livana at D9 gets the same Attack Power and Speed as a non-legendary Fighter who gets boosted Attack Power and Speed.  She would just also cremate them on every other stat and really crush them on Accuracy and Magic Defense.</p> <p>Wait did you say accuracy?  Isn't one of the biggest issues of two handers the fact that they only hit once, so a miss is far more damaging than with a multi-hit weapon?  So maybe boosted Magic Defense and Accuracy isn't as bad as people say, but yes it could have been better.  It's her worst feature, but it isn't a damning weakness, or two useless boosts like Magic Defense and Poison Resistance would have been.</p> <p>So let's get to the good.  She may have no Surety in her discipline but she sure gets free Surety when using a two hand axe thanks to her passive \"The One Who Enforces\".  It even gives more Accuracy with a two handed axes as well.  Considering two handed axes also have defense pen this kind of makes them the best front line two handed weapon, so this is a great uninheritable passive for a Fighter or Knight.</p> <p>Next we have her element.... Water.  This isn't blowing my mind or anything, but considering there are earth users in abyss 1 and 3 I don't see it being much of a thing in abyss 4.  Also while water isn't beastly for Abyss 2, you certainly won't be weak to much in there either.  The fact that the easiest and lowest level Den is also Earth.... well Water probably has some legs on it for the future and isn't a handicap in any of the nastiest content right now.  Also worth a fast mention... Good Alignment means she plays nice with the Lana buff as well.</p> <p>How about that \"Moonlit Pool of the White Daemon\" her inheritable attack?  Well it comes with free range on it so it can be used from the back row or front safely.  On the damage front when used with a two hander it outperforms Heavy Attack and basically everything not called Full Power Strike from an SP to Damage perspective.  (Catch 22, Raging King if buffed by attacks does out perform SP to Damage here, but again, it needs the buff from being attacked).  It can also debuff with Magic Attack Down and outright Magic Skill lock an enemy, even better.... this is actually a fairly common event.  I would say at least 50% of the time it applies one or the other assuming it doesn't kill the enemy.  It can also apply both on one hit if you get really lucky.  The skill bind does seem to be rarer of the two though.  The only real draw back is that it is a water elemment attack, so you probably want to inherit 1 Adam just to ensure you never have a water resist issue with the skill.  That said it does so much damage it can easily score over 2k surety hits at level 1 with a two hander even with only so-so 500 attack power gear.  At higher levels it has shown over 4k with 800+ attack and no other set up or buffs on surety.  In short, for Livana, you really never need to FPS anymore unless you want to conserve SP.  Even if for some reason you hate Livana as a character this skill is so good serves as a viable inherit option for your priests, mages, or other back row DPS because it has the range built into it even when procced with a melee weapon.</p> <p>In short, this skill by itself is a great reason to pull Livana, because while it does lose some damage on inherit, it is not so much that it ceases to be viable.  In fact testing shows it still keeps up with or beats heavy attack as an inherit until Heavy Attack passes it in SP cost.  IE HA 5 VS Moonlit 3.  It is simply one of the better attack inherits in the game.  Much like Raging King.</p> <p>So we have a great passive uninheritable skill, a great inherit skill, her alt class is revealed as Knight which has strong fighter synergy, and her Moonlit toss is so good you kinda don't miss FPS on knight anymore.  Even as a Fighter you will prefer the toss over FPS except in extreme SP conservation situations.  I hate to say it everyone, but Livana is an ugly duckling that grew into a sexy swan. As far as I am concerned she is now one of the best fighters in the game, and from a raw DPS perspective might be the best Fighter in the game.  She definitely has the highest Knight DPS potential as a stock character save maybe Galbadus after he gets attacked say 3 times.  Best part, all she needs is normal fighter inherits and 1 Adam.  She might have some spotty moments with some enemies in Abyss 3, but she should be good to go everywhere else in current game content.  Sure her discipline could be better, but there is nothing else wrong with her in todays two hander economy, and a whole lot that is very right. </p> Shiro's Analysis <p>Back in the day we joked that human-fighter was better than her. Now things have changed.</p> <p>Starting with her inheritance. Past 2h weapon buff it became arguably the best DPT option with reasonable SP cost to inherit. DMG wise on par with Eruption Strike while lacking weapon restriction. On top of that it ignores range penalty and debuff MATK. Not as strong DPT wise as Astral Break but definitely a really hard hitting ability that can hit ranged targets no matter of the weapon you use. On top of that the SP cost is really low. It was a solid option back then, now it\u2019s great. My only beef with it is that skill sealing is niche at best. Because every enemy that depends on it has immunity to it. Unless you\u2019re B&amp;B collab dragon who happens to be weak to water. But oops. He was before Livana was released.</p> <p>Moving on her passive. It\u2019s not much but it\u2019s definitely enough of an upgrade over passive that Gerulf has to put him to shame. Especially good thanks to the 2h axe being the best weapon option in the game as for now (2025). </p> <p>Moving to discipline. I won\u2019t say much there because that\u2019s her weakest part. It\u2019s bad and completely ignorable.</p> <p>Her class change is a knight which is the best she could get and what some people hoped for. There\u2019s not much more to say. More bulk and access to knight defense gives her no dead turns as a backrow option.</p> <p>To sum it up. Livana is in a great spot now, especially as a knight. She along with Galbados are best knight DPT options that either hit like a truck or use knight defense depending on the needs. While skill on lvl 1 is worse SP wise and comparable at best to FPS DPT wise it doesn\u2019t have turn to load unlike FPS. Which makes it way more stable and a better option for DPT which pushes her even more as a knight because she doesn\u2019t need any other option for damage. On top of that she can use 2h axes in backrow without issues thanks to it giving her access to the best weapon type in the game without range penalty. Definitely one of the best knights and one of the better fighters in the game at this moment. She\u2019s one of two characters that benefit the most with recent buffs along with Gerulf.</p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/details/Livana/#adventurer-pull-plans","title":"Adventurer Pull Plans","text":"TheAxolotl's Pull Plan <p>Her kit is just interesting enough to me that I might pull a bit in anticipation of having to worry about long range damage in the future.

He's a great adventurer to skip in order to save for whatever we get in the anniversary! With that out of the way, let's dig into his kit a bit.</p> <p>First, we'll talk about his Bones of Obsessive Love passive. This is pretty lackluster. Yes, he restores MP when he kills something (2 MP, I believe). No, this is not inheritable. No, priests won't often have the turns available to deal damage. No, even when it happens, priests won't often be the ones to land the kill. I love MP restoration, but I can't imagine he'd be landing enough kills to make it worthwhile. One important thing to note is that even though his signature spell deals damage to a row, if you kill more than 1 enemy with that spell, he only gets a restoration amount equal to one enemy. There also seems to be a bug where his spell is the only thing that triggers this restoration. That will likely get fixed, but still - not great.</p> <p>Now, let's talk about his Alchemized Anima Dissolution spell. This is weird. First, it's a combination of a MA damaging spell a MA healing spell, where the damage can be targeted against either row, but the heal is only for the front row, regardless of position. This isn't that bad since the front row is likely what's needing healing the most. Early tests seem to indicate that at skill level 1, when he uses it, the heal is somewhere around 40% of the damage dealt and the damage is roughly 10 damage per PIE, while it gets used by someone else through inherit, the heal is closer to 15%, with roughly 6-7 damage per PIE. The fact that this is PIE-based is the strange part, since there's nothing we can currently do with gear to improve it. It's literally as static of a heal as possible, however it has a comparatively high MP cost. The one benefit of having it be locked to PIE is that he's not reliant on Divine Power to heal. This would let you effectively build him as a battle priest.</p> <p>His Discipline is also weird in that it's the first Discipline we've seen that boosts a Trait (Piety) instead of a stat. Unfortunately, Piety is up there with Vitality as a very underwhelming Trait to boost.</p> <p>Keeping this short for now, and I might add more later. I love the idea of his kit. I think it's really fun and would be a welcome addition, however the implementation of it is what is strange. A priest isn't going to be able to do too much with this due to having better things to spend their turns on, and having the damage+heal locked to Piety is a bizarre choice. Even if you wanted to run a damage priest, the MC or Abenius could fit that bill easier. The one saving grace I could see is that you could literally gear him out as a DPS, complete with damage-oriented skill inherits, and his healing won't be negatively impacted. He could actually make a decent battle priest, however there are much better ways across the board to provide better damage and utility.</p> Frobro's Analysis <p>Another awesome design from the art team, let\u2019s see how the devs waste it. </p> <p>MP Regen Passive. Now that\u2019s a start! Only after a kill. There it is\u2026 What is the idea here? A Marianne-style MP cost reduction is more effective than this. Are we supposed to put him in the front row to try and last hit scrubs with a staff/mace for\u2026checks notes\u20264MP? I\u2019m speechless.</p> <p>Well, at least they gave him a button to click that isn\u2019t Badios in Alchemized Anima Dissolution. 20MP for a row target spell + front line healing is probably a fair deal, but I\u2019m struggling to see when I\u2019d ever want that. Seriously, can someone point me to the exact enemy formation I\u2019d want this for? On top of that, for some reason, they scaled it off Piety; which basically keeps it\u2019s potency capped at around whatever his current level is. I assume you\u2019re better off leveling the spell up to do more damage to get around potential softcaps than doing that anyway.</p> <p>Which brings me to the final point; the MP/Piety discipline focus. All this does is mentally prepare us for the day we get a unit that has a Luck discipline. I always hoped any lich/necromancer type guy we\u2019d get would be something really cool, like having a spell that resurrects non-reversed fallen allies that turn them into uncontrollable units that spam the undead enemy-only skills for 0sp. Instead, we get a normal priest with an expensive AOE life drain spell.</p> Karkarov's Analysis <p>Raffalmao to his credit is one of the coolest charater designs drecom has done to date, it might even be my favorite.  I guess I covered the good...</p> <p>So there is a lot to unpack here. An untyped aoe line attack spell for priest, sweet!  It even heals for give or take 15-17% of damage dealt to the front line of your party.  Cool!  It's damage scales off of... Piety.  WAT?  Not Magic Attack, not even Divine Power, your literal Piety trait/stat.  Well there went any hope of this spell being great DPS, but you know priest's don't have a line attack at all and inheriting line mage spells is costly and not always easy right?  What's that MP cost?  Level 1 Spell, does a little less than mahalito level 1, heals maybe almost madios 1 to front line.... 20 @$@!%&amp;*# MP?</p> <p>Suffice to say this was a good idea on drecom's part, I like where they were going with it.  But damage and healing are a bit too weak to justify that MP cost, and when compared to say 20 MP level 1 Tzalik a spell that could reach 2k surety hits, doing like 400 line damage and healing for 150ish doesn't seem to be as good for the same casting cost.</p> <p>But WAIT!  Raffalcopter has an MP Regen skill!  We are saved!  Huh... only regens 2 #$@%$#@! MP on kill?  Even if you kill multiple enemies it's still only 2 MP?  Insult to injury, because this is the unique uninheritable skill you can't even level it to maybe get uh.... 4 MP?  Both Shelirionach and Marianne have better MP management skills for Priest casting.  This skill is simply lack luster and does not recover enough MP on it's own.  The fact that it requires a kill also makes it unreliable.  Oh, and don't forget, it has to be a kill via damage.  Killing an undead with say Marien doesn't count.</p> <p>Lets remain positive, what about that discipline?  That can change this whole conversation you know what I am saying?  It's increased MP and the actual raw trait/stat of Piety.</p> <p>I am sorry I was wrong, let's not remain positive.  It is interesting that this is the first character to ever boost a raw trait (str, iq, pie, etc) as a discipline, and sure it buffs his spells damage due to it being purely Piety based, but good god it isn't useful at all otherwise.  Almost anything would have been better.</p> <p>In summary this guy seems to have an awesome backstory.  His design is legitimately cool.  The concept drecom pursued for this character was honestly solid, different, very creative, and commendable.  Sadly their execution was not quite so hot.  I really wish I could say this character is good, but he isn't.  Maybe on rerun he will get a new class and that will tilt the balance.  Right now, no, just no.</p> Shiro's Analysis <p>Starting with his inheritance. It's a really solid damage option outdamaging 500 MATK mage lvl 3 MA spell (17 cost) while costing Raffaello 20 with 4 return every turn he kills something additionally giving front lane healing depending on numbers of target hit. Really strong inheritance on himself thanks to his ability to hit high piety especially with discipline.</p> <p>Moving on his passive. It\u2019s 4 MP return per kill. Which gives him the ability to be a really good adventurer with a 2h hammer when it comes to the general content of the game. Really solid option for a priest with access to AoE.</p> <p>Moving to his discipline. So far it\u2019s the best IMO discipline for priests. PIE+MP. Not only does it give better scaling with Priest Weapon Mastery but it also goes really well with the second abyss book giving him a bit better survivability. </p> <p>As for class change I do hope it\u2019s a knight. While a fighter would make him a better frontline it won\u2019t go well with his PIE. And while mage would be nice thanks to MP regen per kill it doesn\u2019t go well with him having a fire element and he\u2019ll need to fight with other strong priest-mages like Alice, Adam or Sheli.</p> <p>To sum it up. Raffaello feels like a test towards bringing something close to lord class in future. Giving him access to strong PIE scaling aoe which doesn\u2019t need DIV to keep the DMG and healing letting him to be frontline physical damage dealer fully. Who will use his AoE for occasional emergency situations. In the future getting a knight will push him to better sport as a physical damage option while giving him access to magic AoE that will scale with knight PIE. The only issue being will be the MP pool which will need to be covered by relics/gear. He might not be the best option as for now but I do love the idea of him playing and in my completely biased option he's a really good pick. Especially if you grab PIE IV, and his gacha gear to push his potential damage from PWM and survivability from the second abyss book so he can be a great frontline option.</p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/details/Raffaello/#adventurer-pull-plans","title":"Adventurer Pull Plans","text":"TheAxolotl's Pull Plan <p>Definitely saving for the anniversary.</p> Karkarov's Pull Plan <p>If you love the design of this character or you are just someone that has to get a copy of every character for their roster, ok, I get it.

This lets him fit well in the front row with Lana or in the back row with Alice and not mess up their row buffs.</p> <p>His Apostle of Breaking Commandments skill provides some nice resistances for himself and any adjacent dark allies. The weird thing about this is that as a priest, he's usually going to be in the back row, which can force you to decide between placing him in the middle to allow him to buff three dark allies, which prevents you from placing a mage in the middle to leverage their secret art. If you place him on an edge, he can only buff two allies. You can also place him in the front row, but the limitation there is that Priests have limited equipment options compared to other physical damage dealers and they have a reduced Strength to Attack Power modifier, which means he'll have overall lower attack and not be able to take full advantage of his own unique spell.</p> <p>His Prayer of Rebellion spell, in a vacuum, is very powerful since it provides both a powerful offensive buff and a conditionally useful defensive buff for three turns. As a row-wide attack power boost that can be targeted, it allows you to cast this on your front line in turn 1 and have that line start attacking on turn 1 with boosted attack power. No need to spend a turn casting Warrior's Battle Cry first.</p> <p>In practice, though, there are a few major limitations with it that make it less appealing. The first is that you can only apply three buffs at a time. You'll likely want to be using MACALDIA, which already takes up two slots, so the order you apply the two buffs is crucial. I haven't confirmed this myself, but apparently the Resistance buff ends up ahead of the Attack buff on the list, so if you want to keep the Attack Power, Accuracy, and Surety buffs from the combination of MACALDIA and Prayer of Rebellion, you MUST cast Prayer of Rebellion first, that way MACALDIA will knock the Resistance buff off the list. If Red Beard is your only buffer, this isn't really an issue however if you're using two buffers, you'll need to pay close attention to speed tuning so Red Beard always goes first, assuming you want to apply both buffs on the same turn.</p> <p>The magnitude of the Attack Power boost from Prayer of Rebellion seems to be comparable to, if not a bit lower than that of Warrior's Battle Cry at the same skill level, with Warrior's Battle Cry significantly easier to get a higher skill level of through inheritance. It is possible to stack Warrior's Battle Cry with Prayer of Rebellion, which can be great if you don't need the Surety or Accuracy from MACALDIA, but most people are probably not in that situation, so MACALDIA would likely still be more valuable to them.</p> <p>If inherited to a different adventurer, Prayer of Rebellion will see a reduction in magnitude of the buff as well as a 1 turn count reduction. This turn count reduction is less than ideal since that can mess with your buff rotation and force you to delay reapplying it if you don't want to knock an important buff off the list. If inherited to Alice or someone with her skill, the two will offset each other at level 1, resulting in the buff lasting 3 turns while other buffs would last 4 turns.</p> <p>He's a solid pass for me, personally. I think his buff, while nice, is limited from its full potential by core game mechanics and he won't provide anything overly unique to my party that can't already be achieved, with potentially better and easier-to-work-with results, with other party members like Alice.</p> Frobro's Analysis <p>I like the idea of something unorthodox, but it just isn\u2019t as effective here. Red Beard is kind of a front-line back-up priest. Male/Dwarf + that Divine Power and Attack discipline point to him being a strong attacker, but when stuck with the weapon restrictions Priests have, he kinda has to be in the front. Fortunately, as a neutral unit, he doesn\u2019t break one of the few well-aligned front-row buffs.</p> <p>He has relatively low MP for a priest and low SP compared to other physically inclined units, meaning you can\u2019t rely on him being your only healing source in extended runs and he doesn\u2019t have the resources to use high-level inherited skills like Heavy Attack to make up for priest\u2019s lack of offense phys damage.</p> <p>The Prayer of Rebellion buff sounds cool, but in reality, it is okay at best. Attack buff feels unimpactful and it takes up 2 buff slots with the Res add-on. Macaldia is preferable unironically. The Dark Adjacent Instakill + Omnibind resist is cool, but not enough to make him an appealing bring.</p> <p>Priests are better in the back with tons of MP, and the front line is reserved for units that can put up big physical damage and Red is neither of those. Wouldn\u2019t suggest using unless you\u2019re dead set on having a mono-dwarf team. Getting Knight as an alt class gave him a real job as a Knight\u2019s Defense/Prayer of Rebellion Spammer and back status cleanser.</p> Shiro's Analysis <p>Starting with inheritance we have access to one of the best buffs in the game for bossing purposes only. Both ATK and res up are there to make it easier to build up immunity with gear or disciplines that have resistance to these statues while allowing you to ignore them in your gear completely. Outside of bosses who use statuses, his inheritance loses value because of the 3 buff limit.</p> <p>His passive is solid. Works well with Sheli or Miliana. But it\u2019s not appealing enough in my eyes to think about bringing him to a team for that purpose.</p> <p>His discipline pushed DIV and ATK which confused everyone to a point where devs themselves named his class to change a fighter in a game as a bug. But he ended up as a knight. Which is better of him but kind of stings that it went in this direction instead of lore accuracy.</p> <p>His class change is knight which just settled him as \u201cbest\u201d niche pick. I wouldn\u2019t use him generally but if someone likes to min max their fights then here he is. Good option vs Sealed Demon or Morgus.</p> <p>To sum it up. Red Beard's purpose is to be a backlane knight who uses his buff for the team and then he sits on knight defense. Basically build on dark super bosses. When it comes to this no one beats him. But\u2026 It's a niche. And I feel that most of the community won\u2019t even attempt superbosses. And those who do have probably enough of an investment in other picks. So in the end he\u2019s best at doing something really specific. And that\u2019s the only thing he does well. In my personal opinion he\u2019s either skip or inheritance for Alice. But I won\u2019t call him weak.</p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/details/Red-Beard/#adventurer-pull-plans","title":"Adventurer Pull Plans","text":"TheAxolotl's Pull Plan <p>Red Beard was a skip for me.

In addition to the ninja skill kit, which is already strong, Rinne has a few really big standouts.</p> <p>Enlightenment of the Brink of Death is the first true support we get for an Evil MC (and Evil characters in general). While the magnitude is tricky to determine, increasing Surety is always good. The buff will always be active for her, and \"adjacent\" in this game means on either side, as well as in front or behind. This gives her a lot of versatility in terms of position placement. Right now, the prime targets for her buff are an Evil MC, Gerulf, and Milana. This actually enables us to run aa full Evil party that could consist of Evil MC, Rinne, and Gerulf in the front row, and Milana, Alice, and Adam in the back row. This party would have both rows buffed by Alice, Milana providing an additional damage buff to the Evil MC, and Rinne providing a Surety buff to Evil MC, herself, and Gerulf in the front. One important thing to note is that she will always receive the Surety buff from this skill - it won't disappear if she's surrounded by Neutral or Good adventurers.</p> <p>Moment of Finality is a very unique ability. It is a skill that deals untyped spell damage on an entire enemy row, which initially is pretty solid, but is made stronger by the fact that it bypasses the enemy Magic Defense AND is based on Attack Power instead of Magic Power. Based on the skill details, the Magic Defense bypass rate is increased based on skill level, so while this needs testing, it likely behaves in the same way that Precision Strike and Armor Pierce do, but targeting Magic Defense instead of Defense. This gives a fantastic way for Rinne to get around high defense enemies, and it also gives us one of our first row attacks based on Attack Power. Furthermore, since it's based on SP, inheriting Debra to Rinne will allow for a boost to longevity through restoring SP on kill. This skill is likely not as valuable when inherited due to the damage loss, however it is a solid target for duplicate usage on Rinne herself.</p> <p>Rinne's Inheritor of the Secret Arts Discipline skill is also pretty solid in that it boosts her Surety, which is always welcome.</p> <p>In addition to the all-Evil party I mentioned above, Rinne can fit in a variety of teams, and she can function well in either the front row with Daggers or in the back row with Throwing Ninja Tools. She can also use Ninja Katanas effectively, as of release, we don't know if the Katanas are treated as Daggers for the Ninja Dual Wield skill or not. She can provide damage, support, and all around general utility with the other great Ninja active and passive skills.</p> <p>While Rinne herself may not be a meta-defining adventurer, the Ninja class initially seems extremely strong and Rinne provides enough uniqueness with her kit to make me highly recommend her as a pull target for those that have been saving their gems for a while.</p> Frobro's Analysis <p>Warning to newer players, ninjas are cool but are not for you. Their high EXP requirements will keep them under-leveled relative to the rest of your party. By the time your non-advanced classes reach lvl 60, your ninja will be at lvl 46. Veteran players have access to potent exp dispatches that can get one from level 0 to 60 in ~11 days. This martial training dispatch becomes available at Abyss 3 Zone 5. Don\u2019t let the newly added ninja junk in fool you, you woun\u2019t get access to solid ninja junk until you unlock the cave in Abyss 3.</p> <p>Now to Rinne specifically. Because of the potency drop when inherited, Moment of Finality is really only useful when used by her, which gives her a niche as the only non-mage multitarget attacker at present. However, the skill is kinda costly at 15SP, which means it isn\u2019t the kind of skill you can use very often. Rinne only gets 1 recovery event if multiple units die to Moment of Finality from inheriting Debra\u2019s Sp regen skill. Thanks to the 2-hand weapon buff, when made into a thief with a bow, Moment of finality can do some solid damage when geared right (a lot of atk blessings). Rinne also has a relatively deep pool of MP with nothing to use it on naturally. I suppose you could use her in a buffer/debuffer role by using premium scrolls like Batilgref/Dilto/Marein/Masolotu/Cortu from the daily shop on her.</p> <p>Her Enlightenment at the Brink of Death passive gives her and adjacent Evil units free surety. Stuff like this is why Evil is drowning and Good is starving. The surety &amp; accuracy discipline is potent for Dual Wielding Daggers or Kunai; no complaints.</p> <p>Right now, ninjas are flashy but take a lot of investment and junk grinding to compare with fighters. Now that MC gets access to Ninja, things are even worse for Rinne as we don\u2019t need her for Dissipation and her use case shrinks even more. An inspired voice performance and a top 5 character model on a kinda middling unit.</p> Shiro's Analysis <p>Starting with inheritance. It's a spell. So you need to have a lot of surety to hit surety hits on it. But it scales with ATK. It's kind of disappointing for me why it didn\u2019t get the TZALIK treatment but looking at how strong it\u2019s I guess it\u2019s fair. Because it puts mages high lvl MA spells to a shame even at lvl 1.</p> <p>Moving to passive. It\u2019s solid. Surety but only for evil characters. Would be better if that includes neutral but it\u2019s what it\u2019s.</p> <p>Moving to discipline. It\u2019s great. ACC is kind of fine but SUR makes it really worth the investment when you\u2019re going to max out Rinne. Especially since thanks to her classes she\u2019ll have a good bunch of surety letting her to get close to hit surety with her AoE or have stable surety hits on bosses.</p> <p>Her class change is a thief. Back in the day, it was the worse option, that was nowhere close to ninja. Now? It\u2019s her better choice. Even if you have the most crazy ebon kunai they won\u2019t be hitting as hard as a bow. Bow scaling with skill at this moment completely outshine kunai giving a lot of damage difference on skills. So unless you use her for basic attacks only or you have a high lvl Ninja Dual Wield then it\u2019s not worth going for her ninja class. Especially when bows are much easier to farm.</p> <p>To sum it up. Rinne has a great class setup, She has great inheritance, she has great discipline, and her passive is solid. On top of that she has a dark element resulting in good state in the late part of abyss 3 fights. She's a solid investment and arguably the best thief and ninja option as for now. And unless devs won\u2019t come with anything crazy she\u2019s quite safe from risk of powercreep. It\u2019s also a good idea to grab MoF on your fighters to make farming a bit faster with AoE spam. Otherwise go ahead and invest in Rinne.</p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/details/Rinne/#adventurer-pull-plans","title":"Adventurer Pull Plans","text":"TheAxolotl's Pull Plan <p>While I'm not a whale, Rinne has easily been my biggest banner investment.

It's an evasion self-buff that also acts as a \"taunt\" with a counterattack. Like Attract Hit and Defensive Provoke, this is not a guarantee that she gets attacked if a single target physical attack would be used. It's possible that it has a higher chance that the aforementioned skills, but that's hard to confirm. It's still nice even though it's not a guarantee, but  unfortunately there are two other main limitations.</p> <p>First, this is a skill and is not treated as a basic attack, which means it is going to be subject to the logarithmic nature of active skill damage and cannot trigger Follow-Up Attack. Second, it will only work for single target, physical attacks. It will not protect at all against <code>MA</code> or <code>LA</code> level attacks, and it will not protect at all against spells.</p> <p>By default, the \"taunt\" portion of Black Beast Feint lasts for 2 turns (the turn you cast it and the following turn), while the counterattack portion lasts for one turn.  If you combine Black Beast Feint and Blessing of Agora, however, both see a single turn increase, leading the \"taunt\" to last for 3 turns and the counterattack to last for two. This puts Savia in a very unique position of being able to use Black Beast Feint on the first turn, then defend on the second turn. Her Defending will activate the Opening status, while her counterattack will cause Opening damage from her skill. This combination makes her extremely potent for dealing with heavy single target attackers like Cyclopses, as well as groups of single target attackers like Chimera.</p> <p>An added benefit is that this skill can act as a one point wonder inherit for any adventurer you want to put in the position of being an Opening activator, as there is no reduction in counterattack chance when inherited to someone other than Savia.</p> <p>Her Soaring Beast Knight skill likely is similar to Wandering Lana's skill in that the buff is relatively minor at just a few points, and only considers the weapon slot and the chest armor slot.</p> <p>Her Discipline skill is a decent defensive boost, but not having any extra offensive boost is less than ideal.</p> <p>Overall, she's received quite a bit of indirect love since she was released, and she's certainly more viable now. Her longevity will depend quite a bit on how many future encounters rely on single target physical attacks and how many incorporate regular spell damage and MA/LA targeting physical attacks. In addition, she's still a Knight and will be fairly SP-starved.</p> Frobro's Analysis <p>What a sick-looking unit, right? Is she a cat; a wolf\u2026who knows? Well, that\u2019s almost it for the pros, now to the cons. Knight isn\u2019t in a great place as I write this. Their 1 claim to fame is Knight\u2019s Defence and she\u2019s not much better at using that than any other knight aside from having a deeper SP pool. Thief for a secondary class gives her surety/evasion-related passives, and precision strike, which are useful.</p> <p>Black Beast Feint is like a better Defensive Provoke. Better in that the evasion buff it grants is better than a defense buff, and the counter-hit has def-penetration, which along with the 2-hand weapon buff means this can do solid damage. Unfortunately, it's still kinda whack because the aggro effect doesn\u2019t feel particularly potent and a good chunk of named enemy attacks can\u2019t be countered at all.</p> <p>The Soaring Beast Knight passive isn\u2019t so bad now that 2-handed weapons like Spears are in style! Her discipline focus is interesting; that \u201cgreatly\u201d increased evasion is no joke; I forget the exact numbers, but it\u2019s something absurd at the high end. It\u2019s like she has a double evasion discipline.</p> <p>This chick is an easy skip unless you need a Dark Knight for Abyss 3 superbosses and even then, there are options like Galbadus, Red Beard, Gerard and Eldorado. As a backrow Evil Knight, she\u2019ll still be able to put up numbers while getting Dark/Evil synergies from units like Alice, Rinne, Red Beard, Arboris and Milana.</p> Shiro's Analysis <p>Starting with inheritance. It\u2019s really a good hard hitting counter. Working well with Savia access to 2h weapons (especially spear or bow) and while a bit of rng based because of how taunt works still does it\u2019s job thanks to cover abilities. On top of that it boosts her evasion, letting her be an even better evasive knight. I personally don\u2019t know if I would give her inheritance to anyone else. Maybe Debra. But it\u2019s worth considering to lvl it on Savia.</p> <p>Moving to her passive while not highly impactful pushes her further towards being an evasion tank. It works well with spear and Le Bicken armor letting her to get decent evasion just with those 2 alone.</p> <p>Moving to her discipline I personally love it because of how strong the evasion number is and how I do love to use evasion units. It allows her to hit really high and absurd evasion values, besting thieves as a knight.</p> <p>Her class change is a thief which is amazing for her. Not only does it further boost her performance as evasion knight is also buffed her damage thanks to surety accessibility. On top of that she gets PS from the thief for the single target damage option. You might as well use her as a thief with a bow but that\u2019s not the best way to use her IMO. Though she still performs as a better counter thief than one other character without access to taunt (Yes Aldric. I\u2019m looking at you).</p> <p>To sum it up. Savia's best performance will be knight with a mix of her counter+cover abilities. She had shown to be able to hit quite hard even against some bosses with DEF up.  Even better if we are facing physical bosses with multiple attacks (like Elmon second cave). Sadly to perform well she needs lvl 1 Alice inherit and preferably lvl 5 to put the best use of her rotations. On top of that, a good bunch of bosses seem to use magic attacks.

This skill can trigger multiple times within a turn, once for each enemy that attacks her. During testing we saw sequences of her evading an attack followed by her receiving reduced damage from two additional attacks within the same turn. This is quite noteworthy, as in theory, she could evade multiple times in a row, really adding to her defensive protections. Mechanically, this skill seems to work by having an <code>X%</code> chance of evading and a <code>1-X%</code> chance of reducing damage. As the skill level increases, the chance to evade increases and the chance to reduce damage decreases. This is quite powerful as more evades means a higher overall uptime of protection, but it's not clear how impactful each level increase would be.</p> <p>When inherited, there is a significant reduction in the activation rate, so it's likely not going to be too helpful when given to other adventurers, but something worth considering for the whales out there.</p> <p>This is fine since her Discipline is one of the stronger ones. While I'm not a big fan of Disciplines in general, <code>Child of the Sacred Tree</code> works great for Sheli since it boosts her two most important stats - Magic Power for more damage and Action Speed for maintaining optimal turn order.</p> <p>The real interesting mechanic, though, is with her signature skill, <code>Dream of the Sleeping Witch</code>. This skill has a lot of nuance to it, making for a very interesting skill. First, it helps alleviate one of the major issues that mages face right now - longevity in long dungeon exploration sessions. If Sheli is below 25% MP at the end of her turn, she will put herself to sleep. While sleeping, she performs two actions automatically - the first is that she nukes an enemy with a dark attack. This attack hits significantly harder than a manually-cast <code>ZELOS</code>. The second action is that she restores a flat 8 MP. This doesn't scale, but it can add up over a long time. If she ends up sleeping for 5 turns in a fight for some reason, she will restore 40 MP, and while she can only put herself to sleep once in the course of a given battle, she can put herself to sleep multiple times over the course of a given dungeon exploration session.</p> <p>There's a specific sequence of events that occur here. We need to verify this completely, but I believe the order of events is:</p> <ol> <li>If Sheli is asleep, perform her sleepy nuke.</li> <li>If Sheli is awake, take an action like normal.</li> <li>If Sheli is awake and meets the MP threshold criteria, she goes to sleep.</li> <li>If Sheli is asleep, she restores 8 MP.</li> <li>If Sheli is asleep, there's a chance for her to wake up.</li> </ol> <p>One important thing to note about this sequence is that early testing shows that if she puts herself to sleep, she's guaranteed to stay asleep that first turn, so you are guaranteed to get 8 MP back. If a fight lasts 2 turns and she puts herself to sleep on turn 1, she is guaranteed to restore 16 MP as long as she's not woken up before her second turn comes.</p> <p>In addition to the MP restore and damage boost, she will not take double damage from attacks made against her while she's asleep. This is quite significant and will go a long way to helping a squishy elf mage stay alive.</p> <p>One key thing to think about with this skill is that the MP restore and the sleepy nuke will happen regardless of the source of her nap. This effectively means if you're in a fight where <code>KATINO</code> or <code>Eye of Torpor</code> gets used against you, she does not have a dead turn, as she's immediately perform her sleepy nuke when her turn came around.</p> <p>Shelirionach's kit is extremely interesting and nuanced. While it won't help a ton during the course of a boss fight, the MP restore can be quite impactful while progressing through a new map. In addition, her race, element, and Discipline are all very favorable towards her role as a damage dealing mage. Also note that while she does have access to <code>LAZELOS</code>, Sheli is the first legendary mage that does not have a <code>Secret Art</code> spell, so you won't get a boosted <code>LAZELOS</code>. I certainly don't consider her a must-pull, but I do personally think she has the strongest kit of any damage-oriented mage released thus far. If you have any spare Iarumas' around, Shelirionach makes an excellent recipient of a <code>TZALIK</code> inherit.</p> Frobro's Analysis <p>I will not mince words here; nor will I exaggerate. Shelirionach is the strongest mage in the game by a large margin. Shelirionach would occupy an S tier by herself if a tier list were constructed for units by class. Fundamentally, she plays an entirely different game than the rest of the field, and the game she plays is much more effective than what other mages have access to. Shelirionach was created by scientists in a lab to be as optimized as possible.</p> <p>Let\u2019s start from the top. Dark/Evil/Mage/Elf/Female gives her a min-maxed stat line and access to synergy buffs from units like Milana, Alice, Arboris, Rinne, Elda, Emil and Red Beard. At the current end-game, (Post Abyss 3) Dark resist is the best resist to have and no boss attacks with the Light element. Her discipline focus stats are Magic Power and Action Speed; the ideal set.</p> <p>Onto the secret sauces. Dream of the Sleeping Witch is a perpetual motion engine; it constantly and reliably fuels Shelirionach\u2019s MP. Unlike other mages who have to pick their shots and use cheaper forms of CC like the AOE debuffs (Dilto/Morlis/Balfeos) or statuses like Sleep to make large groups of enemies more manageable, Shelirionach is free to cast higher levels and therefore more expensive damaging spells, recklessly. Death; the best kind of CC! Shelirionach is allowed to deal, frankly, unreasonable amounts of damage in the long run compared to every other mage in the game while also being just as good at playing the \u201cdebuffing mage\u201d role as her peers. The particulars of how this passive works include some extra bonuses for no reason! Shelirionach will regain MP, cast Slumbering Darkness and won\u2019t take double damage while asleep no matter how she got put to sleep, meaning she is functionally immune to this status condition. While asleep, her Eyes That Know the Future skill can still proc, allowing her to mitigate or outright dodge mortal wounds. WHILE ASLEEP. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, this passive dodges spells just cuz\u2019, making it even less likely that an enemy can interrupt her sleep. Assuming the hit meets the \u201c&lt;50% of Max HP\u201d pre-requisite, it will activate something around 70% of the time!</p> <p>Also, Also; the spell she casts while asleep, Slumbering Darkness, is equivalent to Zelos 6 and costs 0MP. Actually, it\u2019s more like it costs negative 16MP since you gain that much anytime you cast it\u2026at minimum. Oh, did I mention she casts this every turn for however long she stays asleep? At that point, you\u2019re practically encouraged to upcast spells at higher levels just to deplete your MP to oscillate around 20%-30% of your max MP and access this move every battle. </p> <p>My favorite fun fact is that the reworded Mental Unity description specifies that it increases the \u201cDamage of attack spells that consume MP\u201d, but for some reason still applies to Slumbering Darkness. Imagine this; Begin fight with &gt;25%MP. Sheli\u2019s turn, cast Mental Unity, fall asleep +8MP. Sheli\u2019s turn comes back around, still asleep, boosted slumbering darkness for 1300dmg, +8MP\u2026</p> <p>In conclusion, Drecom realized that legendaries need to be compelling and finally made something worth investing in. Do not listen to the downplay. What other mage can do even half of this nonsense?</p> Karkarov's Analysis <p>So the queen Sheli has gotten her rerun and a new class, Priest!</p> <p>So I am going to front load this analysis right now, if you are expecting to hear a lot of negative info, or for there to be catch 22's with Shelirionach... uh there really aren't any catches and I wont have much negative to say beyond \"she is a banner character so you have to spend limited reources\".  Sheli is simply put the best caster in the game at this point.  She was already the best mage, with the priest alt class she is now top of the world in the casting role.  So as of 9/11/25 (when I started writing this) there is no better mage/priest in this game, no, not even Alice, it isn't even close actually.</p> <p>So lets go into why that is.  First off is her unique passive skill which does a large number of different functions.  So \"Dream of the sleeping witch\" causes her to go to sleep if she falls to 20% max mp.  While asleep she will do a few different things.  First, she regens MP every round she takes a nap.  No other character in the game right now can regen MP outside potions (rare and hard to farm) and rest spots in dungeons.  Second she starts casting a single target bomb dark attack that is equivalent to roughly Zelos level 5-6... and she casts it for 0 MP.  To add insult to injury she also does not take bonus damage when asleep, unlike every other character in the game.  Being asleep also makes you immune to other mind effecting spells like Charm.  Best part... this counts for when enemies put her to sleep too, these effects are not tied to her 20% MP threshold, it just happens for sure at that point.  Vampire put Sheli to sleep?  Vampire just made a VERY big mistake, because to Sheli, Sleep is a buff.</p> <p>Then there is her inheritable skill \"Eyes that know the future\".  This skill is actually one of the most powerful tanking skills in the game.  When Sheli is hit with an attack that takes over half her health she will either A: dramatically mitigate the damage making it do significaly less than 50% of her HP or more, or B: Go \"nah I win\" and simply dodge the attack taking no damage at all.  The dodge happens at give or take around 20-25% rate, but the mitigation at level 1 of the skill on Sheli is basically 100% proc rate or so close it doesn't matter.  Also funny story, this mitigation/dodge CAN proc while she is asleep, and it works on any attack that targets her including spells.  This means Sheli has one of the only means in the game of dodging spells, all the evade stacking in the world cant do that for you.  Also somewhat sadly, as an inherit this skill is basically worthless.  The mitigation falls to sub 25ish% activation, and the dodge is single digit percent chance maybe not even 5%.  Leveling it also seems to have little to no benefit so the moral of the story is .... Sheli is not a good character to pull for using as an inherit.  This includes on Sheli herself, leveling the skill basically only improves the dodge rate for her, and not by much.</p> <p>This brings us to the reality of how meta Sheli is for traits / stats.  As a dark element female elf she gets the best possible base stats for a mage, and elf generally have the best caster stats for their racial growths.  Then her discipline is greatly improves Magic Attack and Action Speed.... the best possible discipline for a mage.  You pull a Sheli with an IQ boosted stat at level 1, good bonus points, invest it all in IQ, and she can easily break 90 IQ by herself.  She also has really strong action speed growth normally. So with a weak inherit, and absolutely meta discipline, it is obvious any dupes should go straight to pumping the discipline level of Sheli.</p> <p>Then last but maybe not least... she now has Priest as her alt class.  So if you want a tankier but still strong caster Sheli you can do that with priest.  This means she will also learn all the buffs, debuffs, heals, and attack spells (dark element at least) of mage and priest.  So she is a casting powerhouse.  Oh no!  She doesn't have a buff/debuff extention!  Ok, inherit one Alice on her, now she does.  She is also evil alignment so works with Alice's damage buff on the back row if you want to use both.  Or Milana's damage buff if you put her in front row as theif.  Or a few different dark element or elf based buffs, etc etc.  She is simply very easy to fit into your party comp, unless you are just an auto attack farmer where you don't want casters at all.</p> <p>The most critical thing about Sheli is she is one of the VERY short list of characters in this game where pulling one copy IS good enough to just put them in your team.  Her discipline is top tier, but she does not \"need\" her discipline levels to be good.  She doesn't \"need\" any inherits other than the inherits any caster would want.  You can pull her and she is instantly good to go to do her job, she just needs some gear, some levels, and some normal caster inherits.  Just like every other character.  She just doesn't need discipline, to level her own skill, or to inherit skills from other characters that aren't normal \"Mage\" inerhits etc.  There is no \"gimmick\" to make her work, she just works outright.</p> <p>There are no must pull characters in this game.  Shelirionach is really, really, really close to meeting that requirement though.  This is a character that has no real weakness, has the best MP economy in the game, and has a meta set up for their class and role from a traits perspective.  There is no catch 22, everything about her is good.  Other than her alignment, that's evil.</p> Shiro's Analysis <p>Let\u2019s start with her inheritance. It's a really great passive source of survivability similar to Adam\u2019s. There\u2019s no reason why you wouldn\u2019t want to inherit it just for a bit more of a chance for a better survivability because while combined with Adam inheritance, priest book and WotK your character suddenly becomes something way tankier than you could expect.</p> <p>Moving to her passive. While it's amazing on first glance and definitely great for all around purpose it can be a double edged sword. It surely works great on more regular enemies and bosses. Being basically \u201ccheat\u201d ability for farming purposes. Especially after auto changes as a priest. But what happens when you get into an actual hard boss fight where mages simply don\u2019t perform well as damage dealers and she goes to sleep instead of being able to cast important buff/debuff or heal? Just pray that whoever else in your team also fits this role will make up for that dead turn or few. </p> <p>Going to her discipline, it\u2019s the same as Adam. Nothing much to say. It\u2019s really good but it doesn\u2019t bring anything specific to be worth chasing over her inheritance.</p> <p>Her class change is priest which is completely pushing her further into an amazing position as generalist. Because you can go for endless farming routes spamming DIOS or cleanses as much as you want because she\u2019ll always regen MP. Also the best of course class change for mage.</p> <p>To sum it up. While Sheli is best generalist caster doing an amazing job at farming/clearing abyss she falls on boss scenarios not bringing anything as important as Alice gamebreaking buff duration or Madam/Miliana buff for the team. On top of that her passive ability can sometimes be an issue and ruin harder fights with bosses if you run out of mana fast. She\u2019s unarguably the best caster for general abyss and farming by breaking game mechanics with MP regen but it becomes unimportant/problematic in boss fights where it eats one turn for just 8MP and skill that comes nowhere close to what fighters can hit. In short, she\u2019s falling behind the best caster we have - Alice and options like Madam or Miliana when we\u2019re dealing with a really hard fight despite her min-maxed female-elf-dark setup. Going for knight \u201crecovery\u201d passive is some sort of way to deal with it but then it\u2019s basically ruining the purpose of what Sheli is - QoL for general content that\u2019s not made for bosses in main idea.</p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/details/Shelirionach/#adventurer-pull-plans","title":"Adventurer Pull Plans","text":"TheAxolotl's Pull Plan <p>I really like Sheli, so I pulled for a couple copies with the goal being a base copy and an OCD Discipline copy.

We won't see her true potential for a few days at least since Samurai seem to be following the Ninja's advanced class experience trend, so this review is very subject to change, but at an initial glance, I absolutely love her kit and play style.</p> <p>First, let's talk about her non-inheritable skill, Ephemeral Illusion Stance. This is our first \"massive\" type skill, which hits extremely hard with good gear. By extremely hard, I mean boss-killing hard where we're easily seeing mediocre-geared Shious hitting for 6k+ damage. It does have some pretty big limitations, but it is complemented extremely well by the rest of the Samurai kit in general. Speed tuning your party will be quite important for this, since the 30% HP requirement can put her in \"one more hit will kill me\" range, so being able to heal Shiou up after she attacks but before the enemies attack will be helpful. In addition, there is a bit of anti-synergy with Lana's post-battle heal if you're looking to use this skill when farming, however it should be a non-issue during Sentry or boss fights.</p> <p>Moving on to her inheritable skill, Lingering Blossom is interesting. At a glance, it's a souped up Warrior's Battle Cry in that it provides an Attack Power boost, a Surety boost, a Savia-like taunt, Shelirionach-like protection from dying due to damage, and further Attack Power, Surety, and Evasion increases upon not dying. The additional functionality in this skill is much harder to evaluate since we are unable to see the actual magnitude of stat changes in combat, however it has great synergy with Ephemeral Illusion Stance, as well as a couple other Samurai passives. One thing to note is that the Attack Power boost seems to be roughly comparable to a level 1 WBC, however WBC is going to be much easier to inherit to higher levels, so it likely won't stay competitive from a pure Attack Power boost perspective. The value prop here is in the entire host of buffs that the skill provides. If inheriting to another adventurer, the skill wording implies that the only reduction is going to be on the proc component but not on the initial Attack Power + Surety boost. That needs to be verified for sure, though. Inheriting this to another adventurer probably won't be that useful given the easier accessibility of WBC as an inherit, but it has the potential to be incredibly powerful on Shiou herself, as long as you're willing to spend a turn on it.</p> <p>Regarding buffs, the Attack Power and Surety boosts from Lingering Blossom each take up one of the buff slots, so be careful if you're using this in combination with MACALDIA or Prayer of Rebellion, as you can inadvertently push off a buff you don't want to. The increased chance of Shiou being targeted appears to act as a self-affliction and does not go against the buff count, which is an important consideration. Casting MACALDIA first and Lingering Blossom second results in Shiou having 2 Surety buffs and one Attack Power buff, which is pretty much ideal for her.</p> <p>Samurai in general are at their best when actively using skills, so they might potentially be weaker than Fighters if you're just doing auto-attack farming, however there are some reports of Shiou (or Samurai in general) being able to put out FPS levels of damage every turn, which is quite substantial.</p> <p>One other thing to note is that Cresting Wave Stance actually uses a basic attack for its damage, which is able to trigger Follow-Up Attack. While this won't ever contribute a large amount of damage, it's still a nice bit of synergy that exists.</p> <p>Regarding her Discipline, you can't do any better than Attack Power + Surety for a physical damage dealer. That being said, I personally think saving any dupes for inheriting to her own Lingering Blossom is likely going to be the stronger option overall, just due to the high value prop of her self buff. We can't see the magnitude of the increases, but it should be much more substantial than the paltry increase to Attack Power and Surety that Discipline provides.</p> <p>There are a few important legendary inherits to consider for her, as well. She will greatly benefit from Alice, Debra, and Adam inherits. The latter is least important, but can be quie nice since Ephemeral Illusion Stance is locked to the Air type.</p> <p>All in all, this is probably my favorite kit for a single purpose damage dealer. In many cases, Ephemeral Illusion Stance skill will not be seeing use, but the synergy she has in her kit as a whole is really exciting to me, and I'm looking forward to experimenting with her over the next couple weeks. Keep in mind that many people will not like the high risk nature of her kit, so before pulling, consider what you want from a physical damage dealer.</p> Frobro's Analysis <p>Sheesh; this one is not straightforward at all. On one hand, Samurai as a class seems needlessly complicated for what amounts to damage on par with fighters, or, for more work from both grinding their specific gear and manually using skills in battle, a little better. On the other hand, this feels like Sheli 2.0. Mind-numbingly high damage from her bizarre uninheritable skill out the box\u2026that we can level up for some reason?</p> <p>Let's start with the small stuff. Air + Beastfolk + Female helps alleviate Samurai's lower speed problem without needing to waste buff slots on ASPD, which especially matters here because you\u2019re gonna want all the buff slots for Lingering Blossom (ATK/SUR/EVA). Can we talk about how this is the best of all these \u201cAggro\u201d skills? This makes Savia\u2019s and Aldric\u2019s look even more whack! She just needs to get hit; it doesn\u2019t matter if the hit can\u2019t be countered, and it has built-in protection from taking more damage than she can handle. Getting the buffs even if you don\u2019t \u201cpersevere\u201d is crazy compared to what happens if Savia/Aldric don\u2019t get targeted during theirs.</p> <p>The basic idea is that you use Lingering Blossom to get the buffs and into critical HP to follow up with Ephemeral Illusion to one-shot anything that isn\u2019t a current endgame superboss. This skill is incredibly strong and would futureproof the unit by itself, but then they gave it skill lvls so that it can never fall off (So long as you\u2019re down to codex it)! Oh, and an ATK/SUR discipline because they gotta make extra sure she\u2019s strong!</p> <p>A boss killing Legendary is a new idea, and the trade-off is that she\u2019s a weak auto-battler\u2026in a game where 80% of the play time is farming! Looking at how Abyss 3 is structured, with dedicated farming caves for specific kinds of gear and several optional post-Gatekeeper superbosses, and how this unit functions as a specialized boss killer, I think the direction the game is heading is clear. If I am right, the idea being that we are to grind specialized gear to take down the increasingly demanding, optional superbosses, then this unit could be a Sheli-tier MUST PULL for low-spend accounts\u2026assuming you\u2019re down to put in the work grinding for Samurai katanas. Unlike with Rinne/Kiriha\u2019s dual release, Bugen is not a solid budget replacement for Shiou. I am evaluating Shiou separately from the Samurai class here.</p> Karkarov's Analysis <p>\"At long last the Samurai Class is revealed with a new Legendary to boot!  But does it suck?  No.  However if there are two words to sum up this character and maybe the Samurai class on the whole they would be \"\"It's complicated\"\".</p> <p>Shiou though her unique skill Lingering Blossom gains an attack power and surety buff for 3 rounds, with 1 round of inceased aggro.  If in that round she is attacked, and dropped to 0 HP, she may \"\"persevere\"\" and tank the hit gaining a stronger attack, surety, and now evasion buff as well for 4 rounds not 3.  The surety buff after persevering is also so strong it all but guarantees every hit while the buff is up will proc surety.  Combine this with her once per combat unique uninheritable skill Ephemeral Illusion Stance that can only be used when below 30% HP and well... You get a character that can do damage on par with Full Power Strike level 3 from a well geared fighter with strong stats and some reasonable skill inherits.  Except she herself can get to that damage while wearing \"\"ok but not great\"\" gear, has decent but not impressive stats, and has no skill inheritance or discipline levels at all.</p> <p>TIME TO OPEN OUR WALLETS BOYS!  Hey, hold up now, I said \"\"It's complicated\"\" right?</p> <p>Samurai as a class has a stance dancing system that requires different stance moves to be performed to really get her set with her best possible attack buffs.  This is beyond needing to prep with her inherit skill Lingering Blossom AND be below 30% HP to use Ephemeral Illusion.  This of course assumes you do Lingering Blossom, do get hit, do get knocked to what would be zero HP, and persevere it to get the max buff too.  There is a lot that can just not work out in the process of setting up \"\"the moment\"\" to unload with some insane 4-5k+ damage bomb (or maybe even 9k plus if you are a whale).  Fortunately even if it does go wrong you can also just Bamboo Splitter to win (a default Samurai Skill) that already does near Full Power Strike damage, but does not need a \"\"charge\"\" round, only a round to set up a stance first.  </p> <p>You also need to consider that Samurai gains extra damage from their Magic Attack Power stat as well thanks to the Divine Path default skill, which sounds great, except they also gain less damage from normal Attack Power than say a Fighter.  In fact on many attacks without special set up or prep Shiou with a similar Attack Power to a Fighter, despite also having Magic Attack Power support, will probably do slightly less damage.  Again, without some stance work and proper set up.  This means gearing a Samurai has more options (both plus Attack AND Magic Attack are viable) but it also means they get less bang for buck from those stats.  For Shiou at least this is offset by her Lingering Blossom skill which enables her to worry a little less about Surety than someone without this skill would.</p> <p>Ok great but what else is there to consider? Well Samurai by default have skills to let them buff their weapon with different elements, enabling them to target all elemental weaknesses except Light and Dark. Her Discipline greatly boosted traits are Attack Power and Surety, can't beat that.  She by default has fantastic traits for the class especially if you pull a copy with a Strength boosted to 13 due to high default IQ, Dex, and Speed.  Her Neutral alignment gives her access to the most alignment based buffs. Her Wind element (at least at the time of writing) is not often exploited by enemies in the current high level content, outside of a few easy to kill normal mobs.  The only glaring disadvantages are the class and skill set up complexity, needing a Katana which is very limited on her release (7/10/25), and being an advanced class that needs over 10mil exp to reach 60.</p> <p>TLDR?  Shiou (and Samurai as a class) has a very real learning curve, needs a lot of set up, but when set up correctly has the potential to be the best DPS in the game.  So again, \"\"it's complicated\"\", but also very worth it.\"                                  </p> Shiro's Analysis <p>Starting from inheritance it\u2019s working great on Shiou, Galbados or Savia. But I wouldn\u2019t personally recommend going crazy over it and let your priests do the buffs in a team. It\u2019s good for a niche and surely works well with Will to Fight and Back-against-the-Water Formation but as for now we don\u2019t have a lot of options to use it with well and we might need to wait for GUTS focused class for better performance.</p> <p>Moving to her passive\u2026 it\u2019s actually active this time. And hella strong one. Not only can it be leveled with books it hits like a goddam truck leaving all the damaging options in the forest. With good SPD and porto it\u2019s also pretty much instant ability. And best of all? It bypasses defense. Now. How strong is it? Strong enough to kill anything including superboss on lvl 7 in single or almost single hit. The only issue? She needs to be under 30% HP which can be without issues solved by speed tuning her so there\u2019s no actual risk to it.</p> <p>Moving on discipline. Devs went completely with the idea \u201clet\u2019s make her as broken as possible\u201d and they gave her Gerulf discipline. I don\u2019t need to say much more there.</p> <p>As for class change she doesn\u2019t have any. But she\u2019ll benefit from either fighter/knight/thief for different purposes. One will push her dmg, another will let her play more on low HP and last one will push her surety damage (let\u2019s pray she won\u2019t become mage or priest for w/e reason).</p> <p>To sum it up. Shiou belongs to a new class - samurai which is simple as a stick. You\u2019re either using a counter or spamming bamboo splitter without need to think. If you drop for low HP buff then great, It\u2019s not needed though. DTS from my experience is bad on samurai compared to fighters with axes (lvl 3 samurai DTS was hitting as much as lvl 1 DTS on fighter) so it\u2019s easy skip for a skill in kit. Her elemental buffs are good but first you need to have a long enough fight and boss on which elemental advantage works. Which leaves us with basically 2 choices. Counter or Bamboo - better FPS. Which means we\u2019re left with a simple unga bunga class. The only thing with Shiou that needs a bit of thinking is setting up her nuke which you can drop with poison traps or just wait for it to occur naturally in a fight and punish the boss for what he shouldn\u2019t do - fighting back. Oh, also thanks to being wind beastfolk she have great stat setup with good speed. Because why not?</p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/details/Shiou/#adventurer-pull-plans","title":"Adventurer Pull Plans","text":"TheAxolotl's Pull Plan <p>I pulled 4 copies so far. One copy went to the OCD Discipline, and the others took her Lingering Blossom up to level 3. I might pull more later, too, but we'll see!</p> Karkarov's Pull Plan <p>\"This one is tough.  Shiou has an extremely high potential value ceiling, but is very complicated to use correctly, and has a lot of risk required to activate her true damage potential.  If the game slogan \"\"Savor the Risk\"\" where a character, it would be Shiou.  This may be a little too high effort for some, and is certainly harder to impliment in your team than a Fighter or Ninja.  So, here is what I think:</p> <p>If you are at a point where you just dont want another melee DPS, or you are just starting out and can't support the EXP / Katana investment the character needs, or maybe you just don't want to think a ton while playing.... You should probably pass on Shiou.</p> <p>If you are a person that doesn't really do much auto farming, likes more engagement with their characters and party strat, loves risk based classes and gameplay in RPG's, and just want an absolute DPS beast on your team extra effort be damned....

While she will be impacted by unfavorable type matchups, she innately provides both Earth and Water damage. In addition, she can learn Fire and Air damage through inheriting spells. This, along with her bonus damage to undead, makes her a very heavy hitting for the beginning abyss and the trade waterways. Her MP reservoir is not as deep as Adam's, but she trades the longevity for hitting harder.</p> <p>Her ambush prevention skill is also nothing to shrug off. Some people report that they don't get much value out of it, however I've personally seen roughly half of the ambushes I've had pop up be prevented, and that's pretty great. To make things even better for Yeka, she's a Neutral alignment which has the potential to make her a bit more future-proof than Adam when it comes to team formation. Lastly, if you inherit Adam's skill on her, she'll be able to get the have damage dampening, which will likely be useful, particularly when you're not sure what an enemy's weakness is. In addition that, her Neutral personality has the potential to make her more flexible for team compositions, but this may or may not be the case long-term, since we don't know what future releases will look like.</p> <p>Changing her class to Priest will give him a wider selection of spells, as well, making her a very well-rounded Adventurer for support or damage purposes.</p> <p>One big downside to Yeka is that her Discipline levels do not boost her Magic Power and Action Speed the way Adam's do, however it's very likely that having her Skill/Spell-Bind tolerance boosted will be quite useful in the future.</p> <p>Yeka is a boon to have on any team and due to the ability to hit multiple weaknesses, deal increased damage against undead, and prevent ambushes. She'll likely be a staple in many peoples' party, but recent additions like Shelirionach make her much less desirable than she once was.</p> <p>She still is excellent for being accompanied by Doctor, the best drinking buddy anyone can ever have.</p> <p>As our third legendary adventurer to get a second form, Yeka's is pretty much a textbook sidegrade from a mechanics perspective.</p> <p>Looking at her non-inheritable skill first, Yeka loses her bonus damage to undead, and gains more HP and damage reduction in the back row. This makes her more survivable while dealing less situational damage, however there's a big question of whether or not she needs that extra survivability. As a human, her HP is already higher than that of an Elf mage/priest, and being in the back row, she already has pretty decent survivability. More is better, but it's in no way necessary.</p> <p>On the subject of her Discipline, Yeka gains more HP but loses her Bind tolerance - again, trading something situational for something more general.</p> <p>Neither of these changes are bad, but they're also not groundbreakingly good. Her summer form is a bit more general-purpose, while her standard form has a bit more situational utility. I'd lean her summer form being maybe a hair better than her standard form, but overall nothing worth going out of your way to get.</p> <p>From a visual perspective, this is of course going to be subjective, but I'm pretty sure many people are going to pull for her legs alone.</p> Frobro's Analysis StandardEverdistant Summershade <p>Likely the single most overrated unit by the playerbase, Yekaterina. Don\u2019t misunderstand, she is perfectly serviceable and better than many other mages, but not anywhere near as potent as people would have you believe. Not sniffing the top 3 mages\u2026maybe not the top 5 either.</p> <p>She is positioned in a pretty good spot early game. Bonus damage to the undead at the bottom of Abyss 1 and bonus damage to Earth-weak enemies in Abyss 2 while resisting those enemy's attacks too. But that bonus damage isn\u2019t anything crazy like 2x so it isn\u2019t as valuable as it may sound initially. The further the game goes on the less important this early game advantage looks, even now, Shelirionach outperforms her at those stages of the game.</p> <p>Her Eye of Kalsum passive is whatever. Ideally, you don\u2019t get ambushed ever; which you can avoid with high Detect and not strafing into enemies. I suppose it becomes a little more valuable to someone who regularly uses Morgus contracts which have a set increase to ambush chance, but even then the proc rate feels so low that it may as well not be there. Maybe it\u2019s incredibly consistent at higher levels, but I have heard no reports of this. Her discipline focus is\u2026something. MP + Skill/Spell-bind. It\u2019s not exceptionally good but it\u2019s not bad. Dark/Water Elves get more MP without needing dupes and spell-binding enemies aren\u2019t exactly common.</p> <p>Early access to an attack all spell with Secrets of Maerlik is cool, but she doesn\u2019t have the MP to use it often until around the time she naturally learns Maerlik anyway. But being able to cast the ~15% stronger version is cool.</p> <p>Overall, better than the riff-raff but faces some serious competition from other units that can easily outdo her with easier access to merges or access to other team synergies and utility. (Elf-Mag, Milana, Iarumas,etc)</p> <p>I believe most people look at this one and say \u201cside-grade\u201d, but ignoring the difficulty of getting merges for the discipline, I believe that this is technically better, even if it\u2019s not flashy.</p> <p>HP + MP is preferable over Omni-bind tolerance + MP. Since most enemies don\u2019t have the means to bind you at all and most fights don\u2019t last long enough for enemies who can bind to land it on you, it feels like a wasted discipline focus. On the other hand, while MP isn\u2019t a bad focus stat, it really only keeps her MP relative to the elven casters who trade lower HP totals for higher MP and Mag Power naturally and also have some form of MP conservation/regen (Adam/Shelirionach) or dmg buff (Alice/Milana/Flut/Chadam) on top of that. The same elves that can patch up their low HP pools by increasing discipline levels\u2026The design space for non-elf mages is so bland</p> <p>A tankier mage that\u2019s less reliant on RNG-based mitigation than Adam and Sheli. Trades her 4/10 anti-undead passive for a 5/10 phys resist and small HP boost. Yekaterina is fighting for her life for 5th place! Still overrated out of 10.</p> Karkarov's Analysis Everdistant Summershade <p>Well this is interesting.</p> <p>One one hand she really isn't very different from normal Yeka.  Her Discipline seems a little weaker than normal Yeka with the loss of bonus Skill Bind Resist in exchange for more HP.  On paper losing Undead Bonus Damage and Defense also seems important but I would argue this was a marginal bonus at best considering as a pure caster she never posted \"\"huge\"\" numbers to begin with and Undead are traditionally low HP Enemies.  Her new skill being +HP and Defense when in the back row while not super impressive has a big advantage though.... it is simply always useful.  The Undead skill has no value if you aren't fighting undead, and if we are being honest they are not one of the most common enemy types plus are fairly easy to kill with magic regardless.  Mages can also always use more survivability, especially at low discipline levels.</p> <p>In short it is \"\"marginally useful skill sometimes\"\" versus \"\"marginally useful skill all the time\"\".  I think the new skill with HP and Defense wins in this case.</p> <p>In the end she does everything Yeka always did minus some damage to Undead which seems to not be super high value to me when you consider how easily any mage can wipe an undead pack to begin with.  Losing the bind resistance is honestly the biggest issue to me, but that is also sort of marginal and can always be healed anyway.  Your casters should always carry 1 scroll of unbinding... just in case.  Also I have to be honest, I really like the costume design and think this is a really cool looking version of Yeka with a great vibe.</p> <p>I am going to say I rate her slightly above (VERY SLIGHTLY) normal Yeka, but her long term value will be directly tied to the upcoming character merge changes Drecom makes.  If those changes are lack luster what I affectionately call Summer Yeka will be kinda lack luster (from a meta viewpoint) as well.</p> Shiro's Analysis StandardEverdistant Summershade <p>Along with other, standard banner characters, she has a really strong inheritance, not as good as Alice, Debra, Adam or Lana, but despite it, still a good one QoL. Also unlike Lana\u2019s you can stack it all over your team so unless you don\u2019t like Yeka really much she\u2019ll be mostly food for lvl 6 on every of your character that you use.</p> <p>Moving to her passive - it\u2019s boost vs undead. Nice in the first abyss 7th floor and in third for early floors or catacombs. It\u2019s niche at best.</p> <p>Moving to her discipline - MP is valuable because Yeka suffers from mana issues. But outside of the resistance to spell bind have low value because we don\u2019t have gear to build immunity to it.</p> <p>As for class change. It\u2019s a priest. And honestly? I\u2019d personally run her as a priest if anything. If you don\u2019t use mages as a damage dealer but support, then Yeka value skyrockets. Still she doesn\u2019t bring anything as crazy as Alice, Sheli or Madam but she\u2019s definitely a solid option.</p> <p>To sum it up Yeka is the worst legendary mage with a really bad setup (earth+human) which gives her only survivability. But if Alice as mage can survive multiple 0C GWO roars then I don\u2019t see a value in Yeka having more bulky HP. She\u2019s losing hard to best casters like Alice and Sheli, or slightly worse ones like Adam/Miliana/Flut/Iarumas fighting for life with Dino/Elf-Mag or Emil. But she\u2019s still great for the early part of the game where her buff actually matters on first abyss or in second where she\u2019s earth element. Sadly unless we won\u2019t get purely undead abyss then she won\u2019t see the light. And even if we do then Raffaello with an anti-undead 2h hammer will perform better there.</p> <p>I\u2019m genuinely confused with what devs tried to cook there. She gets more HP which is already completely unnecessary for mages. On top of that physical DMG resistance? For what? Neither 0C GWO or Necrocore can kill Alice or Sheli as mage with way less HP using their physical attacks. So unless we won\u2019t get strong physical backrow damage in A4 then it\u2019s kind of pointless.. </p> <p>But hey her discipline gives even more\u2026 HP. Yeah. Better than base one but unless Yeka won\u2019t get HP scaling skill then I don\u2019t see a point. But hey! Maybe devs really want to make Yeka a MADI focused damage dealer? Because I don\u2019t get it at all. Maybe I miss the future vision where mages get HP scaling skills. Overall worth to get if you use Yeka for merge\u2026 or get it and her gacha gear and go for MADI build?</p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/details/Yekaterina/#adventurer-pull-plans","title":"Adventurer Pull Plans","text":"TheAxolotl's Pull Plan <p>Everdistant Summershade Yeka is quite pretty, so maybe I'll pull to get a single copy for that reason alone.

We'll start with her kit.</p> <p>Thousand Hue Blossom is a very potent signature attack. Think of this as a better Wild Throw, which can hit a single target multiple times. This gives it great use as both single and multi target scenarios. Early testing shows that an inherited level 3 Hue is roughly equivalent in damage to a level 5 Heavy Attack, which makes this quite potent both when used on her and inherited. The Charm aspect can also be convenient, but it's nothing absolutely game breaking at the moment.</p> <p>Her passive, Foxfire Assault, provides a debuff to enemies she hits during the first 3 turns that increases damage dealt to them by the party by roughly 10%. The debuff lasts for 3 turns and is subject to extension from Alice inherits, so definitely give her some of those! If hitting the same enemy multiple turns, the timer gets reset, so she can effectively maintain the debuff for 6 enemy turns without an inherit. Since it is a debuff, be mindful of the 3 debuff limit during those first turns. Also keep in mind that this is enemy turns and not her turns, so enemies that perform two consecutive actions will have this duration shortened.</p> <p>Her Discipline, Pinnacle of the Flower District boosts Attack Power and SP, which are both solid minor increases and, while welcome, aren't going to be as impactful as more levels in her skill would be.</p> <p>The biggest question people will have is around how she compares to Rinne and if she's worth pulling for. Compared to Rinne, she should be consistently doing higher single target damage, which is something that Ninjas currently struggle in. If you want to pick one to run, Yuzu is going to likely be the stronger one. That being said, nothing should stop you from running both, as they are very exceptional adventurers.</p> <p>The big thing to keep in mind with pulling for her is that we have a new class coming soon. Yes, she's strong, but she's released at a time where the meta is 2h weapons with Strength+ and we have no idea what the new class is going to bring to the table. Consider those factors before making your choice!</p> Frobro's Analysis <p>The devs set out to make a strong Kunai Ninja and boy, did they succeed! Look at everything they had to give her to get there, though. </p> <p>For starters, the extra hit from Foxifire is wicked strong compared to a basic attack and is guaranteed to land, even if you miss every other hit of your attack. Secondly, the \u201cincreased damage taken\u201d debuff is like a Lana/Alice row buff without the party synergy requirement if you squint.</p> <p>Thousand Hue Blossom is what Wild Throw should have been. Solid damage per hit, a charm chance and is usable vs a group of enemies and against a single boss enemy. Its strength is compounded by the strength of the 3hit, defense penetration Kunai introduced with her.</p> <p>If you have to use a ninja, this is the one to use, with the one caveat being that you have to give her kunai to use her Thousand Hue skill, and those aren't farmable until Abyss 3.</p> Karkarov's Analysis <p>The anniversary unit has landed and the gooners have been blessed with their fox lady beast folk evil Ninja with Japanese Geisha vibes, and her name is Yuzunamiki!  Is she actually a good character though or just all looks?  Good news, she is definitely not all looks.</p> <p>So the good, as a Beastfolk Yuzu is the statistically best suited race for the Ninja class.  With her banner including a gacha Kunai (which happens to be insanely powerful) and changes to allow the purchasing of heat haze junk with ration points, and ability to just buy a bronze kunai in the item shop, it's no longer difficult to get a kunai either.  This means you can easily slot this evil geishi fox on the back row and be fully effective while working with the Alice row buff if desired.  Her discipline for those who want to push it is +attack power and SP.  I guess it could have been Surety instead of SP but this is still a great discipline for Ninja.  Her one question mark will be the element, as she is Earth.  Abyss 4 has not been revealed yet (10/16/25 as of writing) but there is a strong suspicion it will be a Wind element dungeon, and that is bad for Earth characters.</p> <p>What about those skills though?</p> <p>First up is the unique inheritable skill \"Thousand Hue Blosoom\".  Minor damage?  Doesn't sound good.  Can charm the enemy (only on Yuzu, this is lost as an inherit), thats nice but I feel very situational.  Doesn't break charm if it hits a charmed enemy, ok nice I guess?  12 sp?  Same as Covert Strike, and Heavy Attack 3... I don't know not feeling it...  Random targets?  What is this nonsense!!!!  Oh and it doubles your number of attacks so a Ninja with a normal x2 weapon dual wield set up hit's 8 hits worth of damage.  Oh and the random target is per hit, not \"game randomly chooses one target to take all hits\" so it's functionally an AOE when there are multiple enemies.  Let's test it... oh it seems to get a damage lift on each hit also similar to Heavy Attack 3 at level 1...</p> <p>In other words... imagine if you could full power strike level 1 every turn, but in exchange it costs 2 more SP and you can't specifically target the skill.  Cause FPS level 1 is basically about equal to two uses of HA 3, and this is HA 3.... effectively twice for one skill.  Remember for the same SP cost it doubles the hits value with the same damage uplift, all you really lose is the + accuracy.  Yes, this is basically a one round, no set up needed, might charm, is funtionally an aoe, 12 SP full power strike replacer.  The only thing holding this skill back on Yuzu herself is high defense enemies, but if you get her gacha Kunai.... it has defense pen, and it's a x3 hitting kunai.  I will be specific here and state clearly it's \"hit value\" not \"number of hits\".  You still only hit for the same number you would normally, but it behaves as if each hit is 2 hits + the skill bonus damage.  Aka 2 covert Kunai still only hit 4 times, but each hit is 2 hits worth of damage + the bonus. </p> <p>So how is it as an inherit?  While it does suffer some damage loss and lose the ability to charm it still easily out performs HA 3 for the same SP cost.  Inherit this on a bow wielding Fighter or Thief = profit.  How about on the MC as Ninja with his own Kunai?  This skill gets even uglier at level 3 as even inherited it keeps pace with the HA5 damage bonus.  God forbid you go Mody Dick mode and get 2 Gacha Kunai for a total of x12 hits value of damage on Yuzu or a different Ninja.</p> <p>Seriously \"Thousand Hue Blossom\" is a fantastic skill on Yuzu, and really really good as an inherit.  This skill alone is enough to make this banner something any player should consider.  The only problem is that it is ranged only.  Maybe if we all submit bug reports and claim it should have worked on melee Drecom will cave and change it?  It wouldn't be the first time...</p> <p>What about her uninheritable unique skill \"Foxfire Assault\"?  Well one it has a cool as hell name, but is it a good skill?  Lets break down the wall of text game descprition.</p> <p>Effectively what this skill does is on physical attacks (regular attacks, or skill based physical attacks) Yuzu will do +1 additional hit on a random enemy with the damage being based on her total attack power.  So it tends to hit a little harder than her normal hits, but obviously not harder than say a heavy attack hit would.  It also can inflict a damage taken up debuff on the target (yes the Alice inherit increases the duration), and if the enemy is Charmed it wont break Charm.  Nice.  Even better, she does it on her first 3 attacks per fight, allowing her to keep this damage up debuff applied consistently.  This skill wont burn the house down (lol puns) but it is absolutely a great damage and debuff add that can last into combat for a good bit.  This skill can also proc off Flutter Dream Flash but it is a bit weak there as FDF has a damage penalty on top causing this hit to reduce slightly in potency.</p> <p>This skill makes her a very very strong auto farm unit as well.  Actually with the auto farming changes both of her skills are great for auto farming.</p> <p>Ok well something has to be bad right?  What's the bad Karkarov?</p> <p>...</p> <p>She could have been male for slightly more meta trait bonuses?  She can't use a two hander?  I don't know what you want me to say?  Oh wait there is one thing... other Abyss Guides for this wiki have advised me she is low tier on the Panty tier list due to the black color.  That's definitely a let down.</p> <p>But seriously her skills are awesome and she is now easily the best Ninja in the game.  She doesn't even really need any special inherits you wouldn't want to give to any other Ninja.  Drecom knew exactly what they were doing this time and they delievered a great character that has a very clear DPS and CC role synergy that can work well in both manual and auto play.  Also yeah, her design is great I can't lie.  They did the anniversay character reveal right with Yuzunamiki.</p> Shiro's Analysis <p>Our anniversary ninja. And honestly? A really good one rivaling well with Rinne for top stop.</p> <p>Starting from her inheritance. It's a really good source of damage but locked to ranged only (so either bow or kunai). On top of that it's a random hit. In shortcut? Unlike Rinne AoE which is better than MA, Yuzu has Wild Throw on steroids. Not only is it superior damage wise, but it also can hit the same target multiple times.</p> <p>Moving to her passive. It\u2019s stacking debuff that buffs all incoming damage on target. While on one part it\u2019s great - it's an additional hit and it\u2019s guaranteed on top of it. It also counts to a debuff limit. So can be removed by casting for example MORLIS+BATILGREF. And it\u2019s really not that impactful, similar to Lana buff. But it's still better to have it than another stat passive.</p> <p>Moving to her discipline. It\u2019s ATK+SP. Great option for ninja but not worth chasing over her inheritance IMO. </p> <p>To sum it up. Yuzu has a great setup for being a ninja (if only she had been a fire element instead of earth\u2026) and it's a completely valid option for your team for various reasons. If you need a second ninja and you don\u2019t have Rinne to fill that role then go ahead and pick her. If she ever gets a fighter option in future with access to bow we might see some absurd numbers from her. As for now she\u2019s still hitting like a truck as long as the target doesn\u2019t have too much armor. Sadly without her 3 hit kunai her inheritance dmg drops quite a bit (4 hit instead of 6).</p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/details/Yuzunamiki/#adventurer-pull-plans","title":"Adventurer Pull Plans","text":"TheAxolotl's Pull Plan <p>I pulled multiple copies because despite the current meta, I'm a fan of Ninjas, as well as her damage + utility combination and her aesthetic.</p> Karkarov's Pull Plan <p>This is a simple question.

Yuzu is the clear queen of the ninja class now, and as of writing this (10/16/25) her gacha Kunai even at 1 star white is not only the best Kunai in the game... it's the best one hand weapon in the game.  Even a brand new player should consider pulling here as she can be a great long term party member option, you wont be in abyss 1/2 forever.

Pull 3 copies of Yuzunamiki.  1 to use, 2 to level her \"Hue\" skill to level 3.  If you can justify it, get a Kunai too.

I don't want everyone to just follow my recommendations blindly. I also have had people ask me why I prioritize some things over others, so I wanted to give a bit more insight into what I look at and what I don't when I write an analysis.</p> <p>The main thing I look at are the two signature skills. Everything else comes secondary or is not even considered. The reason for this is because the signature skills are what separate adventurers from each other within their roles or party functions. If you're comparing fighters, for example, race and type (element) do have a minor impact on traits in stats. Usually, though, this is pretty negligible. Similarly, no adventurer is made worse by getting a second class, while some adventurers can be made better by it. To that end, I really don't consider the secondary class unless it's a major gain. Livana getting Knight, for example, is extremely synergistic in a way that sets her apart from other Fighter/Knight combinations, which Shelirionach gaining Priest just adds the same utility that other Mage/Priest combinations have.</p> <p>The signature skills, however, fundamentally impact both the role an adventurer has in a party and what they can provide as inheritance outside of a party. For example, look at Lanavaille. Her two signature skills end up providing a row-wide damage boost for very solid support, as well as a party-wide heal upon victory, which gives incredible role compression. By this, I mean the value she can provide to a single party is quite strong and diverse - her damage boost is welcome in any fight, while her post-victory heal in turn lessens the need to manually heal, thus conserving valuable party resources.</p> <p>Giving her access to the Fighter class doesn't fundamentally change her role as a predominantly frontline staple in many peoples' parties, but it does improve her role compression by adding extremely solid single target damage on top of it. This combination makes Lanavaille easily one of the best adventurers in the game in terms of pure role compression. That doesn't mean I'll always use her, but that does mean she's almost always a good pick in most peoples' parties.</p> <p>Similarly, one big thing that I mostly ignore in my analyses, much to the chagrin of many others, is Discipline. I do this for a couple reasons:</p> <ol> <li>I want my analysis to represent the adventurer to a large majority of the playerbase, which is going to be with Discipline 0 or 1.</li> <li>Increasing the Discipline does not fundamentally change the role or value of an adventurer. It can make them a bit better at what they do, but it doesn't have a direct impact on their usefulness.</li> <li>In general, I think that while increased stats are good, Discipline itself has extremely small per-dupe gains. A more detailed take on my opinion of Discipline can be found here.</li> </ol> <p>When I'm filling out my party and evaluating adventurers is that I always ask \"What can this adventurer bring to the party that is unique?\"</p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/legendary-requests/adam/adam-request/","title":"Adam - Unnamed Request","text":""},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/legendary-requests/adam/adam-request/#unnamed-request","title":"Unnamed Request","text":""},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/legendary-requests/adam/adam-request/#request-requirements","title":"Request Requirements","text":"<ul> <li>Adam must be on the party</li> <li>The maximum Trust Level (white heart on the stats page) must be achieved with Adam</li> </ul> <p>Once the requirements are met, meet Adam in the tavern and he will start the request.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>This request can only be finished once per character copy.

Propelled by an urgent wonder, she raced on, coming to a place where a lone samurai stood against countless brigands-he cut them down, one after another, all the while her eyes were glued to the brilliant gleam of his katana weaving through to battle.</p> <p>The girl approached the samurai, Ouka, imploring that he take her on as a disciple.

When facing an enemy with 0 or extremely low defense, or when your adventurer has a very high amount of Attack Power coming from non-weapon sources, this isn't necessarily a bad assumption, but there are a few things to keep in mind.</p> <ol> <li>A large majority of the player base is not at that gear level, and it's very rare to be facing enemies with next-to-zero defense. The Greater Demon that spawns as part of the Lingering Scent request has ~100 defense, enemies with 50-75 defense are extremely common. In addition, slimes and clouds seem to have 150+ defense.</li> <li>Multiple hits come with a few trade-offs. Each hit in a multiple-hit attack rolls its Accuracy and Surety independently. If you're not at the point where you are hitting 100% of the time missing one out of two hits is effectively a 50% damage loss. If you're not at the point where you're landing Sure Hits 100% of the time, only having one Sure Hit land is effectively only a ~38% to 50% damage increase instead of the expected 75% to 100% damage increase.</li> <li>Battle mechanics such as hitting a sleeping enemy or an <code>Opening</code> only apply to one hit, so the second hit in a multi-hit attack cannot take advantage of the damage bonus.</li> <li>The passive skill <code>Follow-Up Attack</code> triggers on attack and not on hit, which effectively lets it make 2h Weapons hit for 2x damage and multi-hit weapons hit for 1.5x damage or even 1.3x damage (I'm looking at you, Blade Cuisinart).</li> <li><code>Strength+</code> is actually pretty solid. My level 50 MC has 62 STR as a Fighter. This nets an extra 56 Attack Power when using 2h Weapons. When combined with the higher base Attack Power, that gives you a much easier time getting past enemy defenses or increasing the gap between your adventurer's Attack Power and the enemy's defense, thus increasing your overall damage. This increase, particularly when you look at other damage multipliers, can end up outperforming the additional hits.</li> </ol> <p>With those points in mind, am I saying 2h Weapons are better than 1h Weapons? No, I won't ever make that blanket statement. I also won't say 1h Weapons are better than 2h Weapons. What I will do is outline a few areas where I think certain weapons really shine.</p> <ul> <li><code>Follow-Up Attack</code> builds. This skill is very powerful and can easily out-perform some active skills at high levels, while simultaneously saving your SP. You will get the most out of it with 2h Weapons.</li> <li>Turtle builds. In these builds, you generally want your front line to be in defensive mode, while your back line attacks from range. Bows and Spears can be great for this, as well as Daggers and 1h Swords from Thieves with <code>Sneak Attack</code>.</li> <li>When you are up against something with a very small amount of defense or you have extremely strong gear with lots of offensive modifiers (Attack Power, Surety, etc), 1h Swords are hard to beat. Getting multiple attacks in is very good, particularly if no hits miss and all hits are Sure Hits.</li> <li>Thieves that want to spam Precision Strike or Sneak Attack do very well with Daggers, 1h Swords, and Bows.</li> <li>High defense enemies can be overcome very easily with both 1h and 2h Axes.</li> <li>High evasion enemies can be overcome very easily with both 1h and 2h Maces.</li> <li>Front-line Knights with low accuracy can make solid use out of 1h Maces. In this role, they're much more focused on utility and potentially landing a stun than damage.</li> <li>Front-line Priests that have some turns free from healing or buffing can make decent use out of 1h Maces. They, like the Knights, can hopefully land some stuns during turns where they don't need to heal or buff.</li> </ul> <p>One other thing to keep in mind is that switching weapons in-combat doesn't cost anything. You can always pick a 1h or 2h weapon to use as your primary, then switch to something else when you face a high defense or high evasion enemy. Alternatively, if your main weapon is an Axe, switching to a Sword or Mace against very low defense enemies can net you a bit more damage.</p> <p>All weapon types are extremely viable and there ultimately isn't a \"best\" one. 1h Maces and 2h Swords do seem to get the short end of the stick a bit, but can still be very effective.</p> <p>After the September changes, 2h weapons got a massive boost and are almost universally stronger than their 1h counterparts. It's still to be determined if these changes will stay or if there will be further future tuning. TheAxolotl's opinion honestly hasn't really changed. Yes, 2h are the current meta, but you can still clear content without it. Just use the best weapons you have or your favorite weapon types and call it good!</p>"},{"location":"appendices/skills-and-spells/class-skill-quicklist/","title":"Class Skill Quicklist","text":""},{"location":"appendices/skills-and-spells/class-skill-quicklist/#list-of-skills-per-class","title":"List of Skills per Class","text":"<p>List of Skill Descriptions</p> Fighter SkillsKnight SkillsThief SkillsPriest SkillsMage SkillsNinja SkillsSamurai Skills Name Type Level Armor Break Active 14 Counterattack Passive 12 Follow-Up Attack Passive 18 Full Power Strike Active 54 Heavy Attack Active 4 Immortal Strike Active 51 Passive Accuracy Up (Fighter) Passive 16 Passive Attack Power Up (Fighter) Passive 10 Passive HP Up (Fighter) Passive 6 Warrior's Battle Cry Active 8 Way of the Warrior Passive 25 Wild Strike Active 31 Will to Fight Passive 36 Name Type Level All Cover Active 40 Assault Guard Passive 12 Attract Hit Active 14 Behind Cover Passive 32 Cover Active 0 Defensive Provoke Active 38 Fortified Strike Active 54 Knight's Defense Active 51 Line Cover Active 20 Passive Defense Power Up (Knight) Passive 10 Passive HP Up (Knight) Passive 3 Passive Magic Defense Up (Knight) Passive 17 Passive Resistance Up (Knight) Passive 7 Recovery Passive 29 Self-Defense Active 27 Self-Healing Active 6 Stun Bash Active 8 Unyielding Will to Fight Passive 35 Way of the Knight Passive 25 Name Type Level Blinding Active 20 Blood Edge Active 51 Cunning Pursuit Passive 32 Delay Attack Active 6 Glue Bomb Active 27 Hiding Active 9 Passive Action Speed Up (Thief) Passive 17 Passive Detection Up (Thief) Passive 35 Passive Evade Trap Up (Thief) Passive 5 Passive Evasion Up (Thief) Passive 11 Passive Surety Up (Thief) Passive 13 Poison Attack Active 23 Precision Strike Active 3 Sneak Attack Active 30 Stealth Passive 15 Trap Disarm Master's Resolve Passive 54 Treasure Trap Detection Skill Passive 0 Treasure Trap Disarm Skill Passive 3 Way of the Thief Passive 25 Name Type Level ABIT Support 40 BADI Damage 51 BADIOS Damage 9 CALDIA Support 17 DIADOR Support 10 DIALKO Support 14 DIOS Support 0 KINAPIC Support 20 KUSFIS Support 27 LATUMOFIS Support 6 MADI Support 53 MADIOS Support 12 MAKALTU Support 22 MAREIN Damage 15 MASOLOTU Support 3 Passive Divine Power Up (Priest) Passive 5 Passive Magic Defense Up (Priest) Passive 11 Passive Resistance Up (Priest) Passive 18 PORTO Support 8 Priest Weapon Mastery Passive 30 REILIS Support 23 REINIKUS Support 35 Sacred Blessing Passive 55 Way of the Priest Passive 25 ZILFIS Support 29 Name Type Level Air Type Thaumaturgy Passive 55 BALAFEOS Debuff 17 BATILGREF Debuff 13 CONES Damage 0 CORTU Support 18 Dark Type Thaumaturgy Passive 55 DILTO Debuff 5 Earth Type Thaumaturgy Passive 55 ERLIK Damage 0 FERU Damage 0 Fire Type Thaumaturgy Passive 55 FOROS Damage 0 HALITO Damage 0 KANTIOS Debuff 34 KATINO Debuff 3 LAERLIK Damage 40 LAFERU Damage 40 LAFOROS Damage 40 LAHALITO Damage 40 LAMIGAL Damage 40 LACONES Damage 40 LAZELOS Damage 40 Light Type Thaumaturgy Passive 55 MACONES Damage 9 MAERLIK Damage 9 MAFERU Damage 9 MAFOROS Damage 9 MAHALITO Damage 9 MAKANITO Damage 51 MAMIGAL Damage 9 MAZELOS Damage 9 Mental Unity Active 22 MIGAL Damage 0 MONTINO Debuff 27 MORLIS Debuff 24 NOFIS Debuff 53 Passive Detection Up (Mage) Passive 4 Passive Magic Power Up (Mage) Passive 15 Passive MP Up (Mage) Passive 7 Untyped Thaumaturgy Passive 55 Water Type Thaumaturgy Passive 55 Way of the Mage Passive 25 ZELOS Damage 0 Name Type Level Armor Pierce Active 6 Art of Assassination Passive 0 Concealment Active 4 Covert Strike Active 35 Dissipation Active 30 Empty Husk Passive 16 Gale Passive 20 Illusory Mist Active 9 Ninja Dual Wield Passive 25 Passive Evasion Up (Ninja) Passive 13 Passive SP Up (Ninja) Passive 9 Passive Surety Up (Ninja) Passive 18 Voice Theft Active 22 Wild Throw Active 10 Name Type Level Back-against-the-Water Formation Passive 50 Bamboo Splitter Active 25 Concentration Passive 1 Cresting Wave Stance Active 10 Decisive Torso Strike Active 5 Divine Path Passive 1 Flame-Bearer Support 1/20/30/40 Monolith-Bearer Support 1/20/30/40 Quickdraw Stance Active 35 Storm-Bearer Support 1/20/30/40 Tide-Bearer Support 1/20/30/40 True Eye Stance Passive 1"},{"location":"appendices/skills-and-spells/skills-and-spells/","title":"Full Skills and Spells List","text":""},{"location":"appendices/skills-and-spells/skills-and-spells/#skills-and-spells","title":"Skills and Spells","text":""},{"location":"appendices/skills-and-spells/skills-and-spells/#active-skills","title":"Active Skills","text":"Skill DescriptionSkill Source Name Inheritable Restriction Effects Detail Alchemized Anima Dissolution True Deals moderate untyped spell damage based on Piety to 1 enemy row.

There are no missions for this event in particular.</p> <p>There are several map variations, and are random upon entering. It is not necessary to explore the whole map, you simply need to make it to the end and defeat the floor boss.

It has around ~7.5k HP. It has no element, and is affected by Magical Beast Slayer,</li> <li>The Minotaur has a set order of actions. It will do nothing on Turn 1, 2 turn Defense buff on Turn 2, 10 turn Accuracy buff on Turn 3, 10 turn Attack buff on Turn 4, then begin attacking on turn 5 onwards with a CT down skill and Row-switching skill.</li> <li>Katino and Kantios are effective but not guaranteed on the Minotaur.</li> </ul> Advanced Difficulty Fight Tips <ul> <li>The final enemy is always a Vampire. He has around ~7k HP. Vampires are dark element, and is affected by Vampire Slayer.</li> <li>He will generally just basic attack that can be consistently dodged with 150~ evasion. Alternatively he may cast Zelos</li> <li>He is susceptible to openings, which will inflict around 1k damage</li> <li>He will cast Kaltu on himself at around half HP (~3.5k HP). When he is at low HP (~1k HP) he will do a 1 time Vampire Bats skill that inflicts very high damage. He will heal for about 10x of what the vampire bats hit on you.</li> <li>It's recommended to try to chip him down to a point where you can finish him off in one turn with Full Power Strike from all 3 fighters.</li> </ul> Efficient Strategy for Vampire Slaying <p>Assuming you have three fighters that are able to deal 1k+ damage per hit with FPS, you can easily kill the vampire in 6 turns using the following strategy. Buy some Scrolls of Shared Power from the shop if you want to try this.</p> <ul> <li>Turn 1: Use MORLIS, Armor Break, and Scroll of Shared Power</li> <li>Turn 2: Use FPSx3</li> <li>Turn 3: Smack the Vampire for 3k+ damage. He'll use KALTU.</li> <li>Turn 4: Use MORLIS, Armor Break, and Scroll of Shared Power. Note that if the Vampire is faster than one or two of your party members, use BATILGREF instead of MORLIS this turn</li> <li>Turn 5: FPSx3</li> <li>Turn 6: Smack the Vampire for 3k+ damage. Around the first or second hit, he'll yell at you in Japanese. As long as your party all acts before he does next (thus the conditional BATILGREF), you'll kill him before he can bat you.</li> </ul> Master Fighter Ring <p> - The Fighter ring is always 4* Red and has fixed stats.

On the other hand, Lead Grade is maybe around 5.5k HP. Bronze Grade is around 7.5k HP.</li> <li>It's highly recommended for players Bronze Grade or lower to farm the Dragon Slayer weapon and upgrading it to +10 or so before attempting, as it's extremely strong for that level range.</li> <li>The dragon is susceptible to Paralyze, not Stun. This is most likely to encourage people to use Iarumas's unique skill that paralyzes. Other sources are also more effective than usual but not guaranteed (Mimic Secretion, Thunder Strike, etc).</li> <li>The dragon can be spellbound, but it does not stop its roar or breath. However, it will be more inclined to use basic attacks that can be exploited for openings.</li> <li>Evasion helps mitigate a lot of physical moves the dragon does, but requires a large amount (possibly 200+ for Steel Grade).</li> <li>Water elemental weapons and spells help deal more damage to the dragon. Water armor helps resist the fire breath.</li> <li>Cortu can mitigate some damage from the breath and magic, as Iarumas suggests, but as the dragon can sometimes go twice in a turn with mixed damage, it may not be enough alone.</li> <li>If your team has enough damage, consider using Knight's Defense to mitigate damage if your team's gear is not specced to deal with the dragon specifically</li> <li>It's suggested to have two priests as the dragon can hit the entire team all at once, so having heals for both rows helps a lot.</li> <li>You need a minimum of 43 ASPD to outspeed the dragon at Steel Grade.</li> </ul> 2nd Run <ol> <li>Watch cutscene of Lulu looking for info.

First, and most commonly, a Character will have clearly improved growth in one Trait.  Normally this is visible at level 1 on character creation by 1 Trait being 1 point higher than normal.  However, this is not always the case.  This is a \"buff\" to the Trait growth rate, not an extra Trait point.  So it's possible to recieve a single Trait Boost/IV on a Trait that has poor growth for the Character/Class.  For example: a Dwarf Knight may not show an extra point of Speed at level 1, but may have a Speed Boost/IV. The second way this can manifest is as a \"Neutral\" Boost, where all Traits recieve a very small increase in growth.  This variety will not be visible at level 1 as all Traits will be their normal value.  </p> <p>It is important to note that this means you cannot tell if a given Character copy has a single Trait Boost/IV or a Neutral one at level 1 if all Traits are the normal value.  Generally speaking, leveling a Character to level 20-30 will reveal what type of Boost/IV is happening for this particular Character copy in this situation.  This is important to understand because your Character may have a Boost/IV in an undesireable Trait.  Such as a Human Fighter with a Boost/IV of Piety.</p> <p>You should know and understand that Boost/IV is just a bonus.  A Characters Trait growth is primarily driven by their Class, and Race.  An Elf Mage will always have great IQ even if their Boost/IV is Dexterity.  Even if you should have a Boost/IV with a high degree of synergy (for example a Beastfolk Thief with Speed Boost/IV) the difference between \"normal average\" and \"Boost/IV\" will generally only be 6-10 points.  If the Boost/IV is a single Trait with poor synergy (for example a Human Ninja with Vitality Boost/IV) the difference between normal average and the Boost/IV will be lower, commonly around 5-7 points. </p> <p>The biggest unknown around Boosts/IVs, though, is exactly what this means for long-term Adventurer development. Assuming we will eventually be at a maximum level of 130, it's possible that the Boost/IV means a particular Trait Point will get to a \"maximum value\" faster but by level 130, all copies of an adventurer will have the same Trait Point values.</p> <p>TheAxolotl's personal opinion on IVs is that when you have multiple copies of an adventurer to register, select the one with the IV that you prefer, as that will make a more currently notable difference in Trait Point growth than bonus points will. When you don't have multiple copies, don't worry about the IV. We don't know how IVs will play out long-term, so I personally think it's not worrying about.</p> <p>Karkarov's personal opinion is much the same as TheAxolotl's.  Ultimately it depends on the player, those who are happy to spend money and \"whale\" should absolutely be picky and wait for that perfect Character copy with the desired meta level 1 Traits.  For the average player who is Free to Play you should just use what you have and know that this is not going to make or break a Character.

We don't have a full understanding of the degree of variance from level growth and Boost/IV, but when looking at those two Adams, using the chart above, you can see that there's only a difference in Magic Power of <code>(73-59)*1.2=16.8</code>.

Ultimately, the impact of trait points on stats is significantly smaller than the impact of equipment on stats.</p> <p>One popular myth to be aware of, \"Lower Fortitude = Highter Trait Growth\".  This is a popular theory on Social Media based on anecdotal observations but is not true. A lower Fortitude Adventurer does not benefit from extra Trait growth and is no more likely to have high Trait growth than a 100 Fortitude character.</p> <p>What about Legendary VS General VS Anonymous Adventurers, is there a difference?  Advanced Classes VS Normal Classes?  Yes, there is a difference on both counts.</p> <p>Legendary Adventurers generally have slightly higher overall Trait growth VS General and Anonymous Adventurers, while General and Anonymous Adventurers have the same growth.  Likewise Advanced Classes (Samurai and Ninja) generally have higher Trait growth than the Standard Classes.</p> <p>Please understand this will not massively impact a non Legendary or Advanced Class Adventurers potential.

The key word here is effectively. Out of our standard Legendary pool, Lanavaille probably has the single best role compression out of any legendary in this game. Through her Fighter class, she can be a primary Damage Dealer, gain some Support/Utility functionality through her Knight class and her passive damage boost, and provide some post-battle healing through her passive. This combination easily makes her one of the best adventurers you can run for a large majority of teams and throughout all content.</p> <p>Other more generic examples of this could be class combinations such as Fighter/Priest, Mage/Priest, Ninja/Thief, and even Fighter/Mage. These class combinations are focused around providing additional supportive functionality to the primary class through the secondary class.</p>"},{"location":"strategies/party-construction/#role-mastery","title":"Role Mastery","text":"<p>Unlike Role Compression, this one is focused on excelling in one role and not worrying about doing other things. Samurai, Fighter/Thief, Ninja/Thief, and Priest/Mage are big examples of this. Samurai does one thing and that's be a powerhouse single target damage dealer. While there is some element of role compression with Fighter/Thief and Priest/Mage, these class combinations are more geared toward improving the ability to perform a single role (Fighter/Thief boosts Fighter damage, Ninja/Thief boosts Ninja damage, while Priest/Mage boosts Priests support). You might have also noticed that a couple of these class combinations appear in both the Role Compression and Role Mastery groupings. This makes those class combinations especially powerful since it provides utility while also increasing primary role capabilities.</p>"},{"location":"strategies/party-construction/#turn-economy","title":"Turn Economy","text":"<p>This one is a bit more complex. Turn Economy is essentially a way of evaluating the value of an action taken during a turn. For example, a non-Alice priest has buffs that last for 3 turns, while Alice, due to her inheritable passive, has buffs that last for 4 turns at skill level 1. This gives Alice better Turn Economy than other priests since she can ultimately take more actions before having to reapply her buffs. It's also what makes her inheritable skill so strong - inheriting her skill to any adventurer with a buff or debuff will extend that duration by 1, giving the target adventurer better overall Turn Economy.</p> <p>Similarly, one of the big reasons Full-Power Strike is such a good attack is because of its efficiency and its turn economy. For example, you can have a Fighter use FPS on the first turn and have two turns of buffs be applied to that Fighter by a faster Priest before the FPS attack actually happens. This means you don't have to wait a turn for your Fighter to be fully buffed before attacking. Similarly, if you get hit by the Gatekeeper's Roar, you can have the Fighter use FPS while they're in the back row, then have the adventurer in front of them swap positions before the Fighter actually attacks.</p>"},{"location":"strategies/party-construction/#party-formation","title":"Party Formation","text":"<p>With these concepts in mind, how do you use them to make a powerful party?

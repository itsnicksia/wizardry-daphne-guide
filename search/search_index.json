You can get new Adventurers by reversing Adventurer and Legendary Bones, acquired from chests, daily rewards, Jeweler purchases, missions and the Mausoleum. How do I get the Featured Adventurer? You can get a Featured Adventurer by reversing their bones, purchased from the Jeweler. You will need 100 Reversals for enough tokens to exchange directly for the Featured Adventurer. How many Gems to guarantee the Featured Legendary Adventurer? 18,200 Gems if you're buying 11 Featured Bones for 2000 Gems each time. This will give you 100 Tokens to purchase the Featured Adventurer from the Exchange. Which Bones should I buy? Featured Legendary Bones. Buying <code>Adventurer's Remains</code> is not recommended. When should I use <code>Adventurer Bones</code> and <code>Legendary Bones</code>? Up to you. You can use them to strengthen your party with new adventurers, Discipline, and Skill Inheritance, or save for when new Adventurers are added to the pool. What should I get with Guild Points? Gems and Adventurer's Bones. Do Banner Tokens carry over to other banners? No. Not even for re-runs of the same banner. What is the difference between Gems of Org (Green) and Gems of Erin (Purple)? Purple Gems can only be obtained with real money, and are used to purchase Purple Legendary Bones and daily Skill Books. Green Gems can be obtained from daily rewards, purchases, and missions. Why does the Featured Legendary Adventurer have two banners? One banner uses Purple Legendary Bones which awards additional Featured Equipment when pulling the Featured Adventurer. Is Featured Equipment worth it? Not really. The random quality and grade make it risky. There are rare exceptions, such as the 3-hit Cuisinart Sword. What should I spend my Gems on? Legendary Adventurer Bones and Class Change scrolls. Which purchases have the best value? Experience and Class Remains packages have the most Gems per dollar. See Purchase Evaluation page for more information. Is there a Pity System? No. Is there a Spark System? Yes. Each pull on a Featured Adventurer Banner gives a token which can be used exchanged for the Featured Adventurer (100 Tokens), Featured Equipment, Skill Books, and other items. Will Featured Adventurers be added to the Permanent Banner? Drecom has announced that they will, but none have been added as of December 2025.  As of January 15, 2026, the Permanent Banner was changed.  Adventurer's Remains and Legenendary Adventurur's Remains were split into Type I and Type II:  Type I retains the original set of General and Legendary Adventurers (Lanavaille, Alice, Adam, Yekaterina, Gerulf, Debra).  Type II Adventurer's Remains includes the normal General Adventurers plus the Greedy Saintess Marianne alternate style, and the Legendaries are changed to Wanderer Princess Lanavaille, Gerard, Abenius, Red Beard, Rinne, and Savia.  Most in game remains still appear as Type I, but Adventurer's Remains (not Legendary Remains) can be freely exchanged between the two Types in the Ruins. Additionally, reversing Type I and Type II remains in the ruins now give tokens that can be redeemed at the Jeweler exchange for various items costing up to 150 tokens each. The exchange resets monthly but tokens carry over. <p>For more detaileds on the Gacha and game economy, resource accumulation, and usage please see the Free-to-Play Resources page.</p>"},{"location":"frequently-asked-questions/#adventurers","title":"Adventurers","text":"Question Answer I got two copies of an adventurer and they have different stats. Is that normal? Yes. Characters can have slight variations in base stats (usually up to 1 extra point), bonus points (up to 10), and Fortitude (80, 90, 100). If you intend on doing a lot of summons, don't feel like you have to invest in the first version you get.

Your primary goal is to complete the request to Save the King!  It's not as easy as it sounds, and it may take you a few tries. The key is to keep progressing in the story despite setbacks and you'll eventually learn how to get the job done right.  Each floor has a very similar square layout with various events, side quests, tricks, and traps. The one exception to this is a side dungeon on the third floor called the \"Goblin Den\". You will be warned away from this area if your level is too low.  Savor the risk but DON'T IGNORE WARNINGS FROM THE GAME! </p>"},{"location":"abyss-guides/1-beginning-abyss/maps/#maps","title":"Maps","text":"<p>Map Variations</p> <ul> <li>Some floors have tile variations (shifts and rotations) randomly chosen when you start the abyss, and certain actions can reset the dungeon layout changing the variation you see. Two variations of the maps with tile changes are included below, but your maps and the location of certain events may not perfectly match these.  </li> <li>Events and items on variable tiles always occur in the same rooms on those tiles even though they may have moved and rotated, so look for similar features. See Map Variations page for details.  </li> </ul> B1F -Pit- <p>Note</p> <p>Not much to say, first floor, welcome. Look for the Beginning Abyss Key for a nice surprise on floor 2. Make sure to talk to Chris and Mudd to eventually unlock bondmate quests. They're the two adventurers on the left and right side dead ends when you first enter.</p> Variation 1Variation 2 <p> </p> <p> </p> B2F -Temple- <p>Note</p> <p>You will fight your real first boss here. Not much to say, use the harken afterwards. Only important thing of note is the room to the right has an infinite respawn mob that you can grind on early levels. If you found the key on B1F, the locked room on the left will have a few Adventurer's Remains to help you build your team (one time only).</p> <p></p> B3F -Cave-In Zone- <p>Note</p> <p>Continue your way through the level until the story forces you examine the rocks around you. Examine all surrounding surfaces in all directions enough times and you can clear the rocks and proceed. Make sure you clear all rocks on the level to find important knowledge. There's a camp that restores all your hp/mp/sp and can eventually let you have conversations with trusted allies. It can be used once each time you enter the labyrinth. The Goblin's nest is not worth doing yet. Listen to Lulu, leave it for later.</p> Variation 1Variation 2 <p></p> <p></p> B4F -Labyrinth <p>Note</p> <p>First time here? You get to watch your friends die. Second time here? Fix it! This is the first time the game shows you raising a stone will change certain map paths, that's really it. Keep moving the stones until a path opens up. Those two chests in the northwest? You can only pick one (the left has an adventurer's bone). Oh, watch out for the rabbits. They've got a vicious streak a mile wide.</p> Variation 1Variation 2 <p> </p> <p></p> B5F -Warped One's Nest- <p>Note</p> <p>The top left side in the beginning of the map is the 'warped one's nest', I don't suggest going there unless you're prepared. The larger rectangular area will have a boss for you. Prepare accordingly. Also, check this map to avoid the poison tile paths (except for maybe the Adventurer's Remains in the chest at the end of the long path).  There are also two very good iron-grade weapons to be found in the three-chest rooms.</p> <p></p> B6F -Map Killer- <p>Note</p> <p>These dead men tell tales.  The first corpse tell you which door will have spikes behind it.  The next two will tell you the correct warp order matching the sun (north then west, like the setting sun). Statue room puzzle requires you to restore the statue heads that match your party members according to the clue on the nearby dead body. If none match, leave all heads broken. This clue can change every time you enter this level. See answers in the FAQ. Saint shield quest is also completed here; do the second warp wrong and fight the mob.</p> Variation 1Variation 2 <p></p> <p></p> B7F -Amongst the Dead- <p>Note</p> <p>You will need to go through the poison floors every time UNTIL you reverse the stones on B8F which will create shortcuts. B8F description tells you which stones open which paths. Make sure to do that. Albano will REALLY not like you here, unless YOU DO something correctly. The camp here is important as you can't access the Harken on the next floor until you beat the final boss. </p> Variation 1Variation 2 <p></p> <p></p> B8F -Deepest Depths- <p>Note</p> <p>The four stones on this floor can be reversed to create new paths on B7F.  Starting from the entry stairs, the closest two stones creates paths on B7F at X:21,Y:11 and X:12,Y:2 letting you reach the unreachable treasure chests. The third stone connects the entry room to the hallway with the Camp by adding a path on B7F at X:8,Y:14.  The fourth stone connects the hallway with the Camp to the hallway with the stairs down to B8F by adding a path on B7F at X:14,Y:15.  No, you must kill the boss to reach the Harken. Yes, there are mimics now. They hurt, but good news, defending their attack gives you a big opening for massive damage. Good luck on the boss, and hope your head won't fly.

Completion without advancing at least to Bronze Grade is possible but a significant challenge. One can grind out Undead March Request from the Beginning Abyss to level up.  </li> <li>A vast majority of the enemies in this Abyss are water element, so it helps to get as many earth-element weapons and armor (preferably to +10) from the Earth Den.  Many monsters are also \"Magical Beasts\", so characters and weapons with the \"Magical Beast-Slayer\" trait are also  useful.  </li> <li>Iron/Steel level gear are commonplace drops in this Abyss, so it's recommended to begin building some in preparation for Abyss 3.  </li> <li>Do not sell all of the Sahuagin Scales you obtain as you begin this Abyss, as they are needed for a mandatory late main story request.  You will need 5 each time you complete that request, and you'll have to go back to find more if you've sold them all.  </li> <li>Fully completing this Abyss involves finding and reading all of the Mermaid statues.  Some are unreachable until you learn how to reverse the water statues. The map below shows their locations and 'message numbers' so you can locate any that you are missing:   </li> </ul> Mermaid Statue Locations <p>There are areas where you are carried by a strong current. You must unlock the ability to reverse the water statues. Some have a timer to become cursed again. Some areas will be completely submerged, and water-type monsters will be much faster and stronger there. You should always try to lure monsters out of the water in these areas.</p>"},{"location":"abyss-guides/2-port-town-grand-legion/maps/#maps","title":"Maps","text":"<p>Map Variations</p> <ul> <li>Some floors have tile variations (shifts and rotations) randomly chosen when you start the abyss, and certain actions can reset the dungeon layout changing the variation you see. Two variations of the maps with tile changes are included below, but your maps and the location of certain events may not perfectly match these.  </li> <li>Events and items on variable tiles always occur in the same rooms on those tiles even though they may have moved and rotated, so look for similar features. See Map Variations page for details.  </li> </ul> 1st District - Back Alley Variation 1Variation 2 <p></p> <p></p> <p>Note</p> <ul> <li>There are some locked doors here.  The key will become available to you later in the story and you can come back to collect any chests behind the doors.</li> </ul> 2nd District - Black Market <p></p> <p>About this floor</p> <ul> <li>The mermaid statue on this and subsequent floors give important lore both contextually and are significant for being able to fight Octonarus. Make sure to get their knowledge by clicking on each statue's plaque.</li> </ul> 3rd District - Iron Gate Street <p></p> <p>About this floor</p> <ul> <li>Your first scripted battle is on this floor against a Lizard Commander, at the end of the floor.  This is a strong enemy with a lot of armor.  The best strategy is to block and create openings if your team is undergeared and/or underleveled.</li> </ul> 4th District - Boulevard <p></p> <p>About this floor</p> <p>This is the game's first Death Trap.  You will be locked in a room and drowning, taking gradual damage. Heal with items as needed and take as few steps as possible! To learn to activate the statue and drain the water you will need to try leaving the area through (1) the upper left and (2) upper right sections of the room you\u2019re in as well as (3) attempt to go back into the current that pushed you into the room, then try to activate the statue.  (Some people have reported -version 1.13.0 and later- being unable to progress unless you first try to 'use' the statue, then try and fail to walk into all three paths out, and then try one more time to 'use' the statue. If you have repeat trouble you can try getting to this area with just the main character to avoid having to pay to resurrect your whole team multiple times.)</p> 5th District - Sunken City Variation 1Variation 2 <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>About this floor</p> <p>There are quite a lot of flooded rooms in this floor. You cannot cast magic while underwater, so carry scrolls on spell users, and trigger/lure enemies out of the water. Aquatic enemies like Sahuagin gain significant action speed and evasion boosts while underwater.</p> 6th District - Warehouse <p></p> <p>About this floor</p> <p>There is another scripted battle on this floor against an Oar Collector. It is advised to turn off the northwest most dragon statue via the north path before fighting the Oar Collector as it will grant 3 turns of unsubmerged combat before the water levels rise again.  The Oar Collector is vulnerable to Earth weapons and magic.  The only Camp in this Abyss is on this floor, but it's not nearly as convenient to access as the Abyss 1 B7F Camp. Take advantage of it to prepare for the Oar Collector.</p> 7th District - Pier <p></p> <p>About this floor</p> <p>There are no enemies on this floor, but a few important people to talk to, and some things to find if you look around hard enough.  This is also a common place to find some of the wandering NPCs who roam the 2nd Abyss.  The small separate section in the northeast can be reached by the nearby stairs underwater.</p> Seaside of the Dead <p></p> <p>About this floor</p> <p>There are no enemies on this floor, though you can fight the Sahuagin for the object it picked up if you accepted the small quest from the woman above.</p> Lower Deck 1 -Ship's Hold- <p></p> <p>About this floor</p> <p>There are a lot of enemy spawns on this floor, and no real way to avoid them as there are narrow corridors. In the southwest you will find the NPC with the key for all the locked doors in the previous floors, as well as a 'magic shop' with a very knowledgable owner.</p> Lower Deck 2 -Lounge- <p></p> <p>About this floor</p> <p>Welcome to the farming floor. This is one of the best places to get find equipment at this point of the game. You can come up from the Lower Deck 1 Harken, grab any chests that spawn in the northern half of the floor, leave, and repeat. There is the ship's cook here which will be central to some Arena progress, but his meals also give you a big once-per-visit stat restoration. There are more scripted fights here related to the main story that will take place in submerged areas. Remember to bring scrolls for your spellcasters, and look for the statues to temporarily drain the water!  </p> <p>The person blocking the stairs to the Upper Deck will tell you to get three arena tickets to proceed. We obtain these in the usual manner: murder.  You will need to win three fights in submerged areas at the locations shown below. Don't forget to reverse the nearby statuse to get a little dry time before they re-flood.</p> Ticket fight locations <p></p> Upper Deck -Arena- <p></p> <p>About this floor</p> <p>There are no enemies of this floor, but there are a lot of mandatory deaths here. You will need to beat five rounds to win, and several are scripted death fights. After each death, you will review options to 'strategize' and make them winable. You can harken to Lower Deck 2 and come up to the arena without risk of combat, so best to take your party members out before going into each a scripted death fight for the first time!  For fight descritions, see the Arena section of the Important Requests page. After winning a few rounds, stairs in the northwest become unblocked giving you access to a room with a chest of gold. Later you can get the key to the captain's treasure hold to open the trapdoor in the north east. Only after defeating the greater warped one can you can finally access the part of the deck with the major Harken. </p>"},{"location":"abyss-guides/2-port-town-grand-legion/requests/","title":"Requests","text":""},{"location":"abyss-guides/2-port-town-grand-legion/requests/#port-town-grand-legion-requests","title":"Port Town Grand Legion - Requests","text":"<p>Key locations can change due to some maps having variable layouts.

This drop you into the sight of the Corruption Sentry, but right outside of the Zone 9 Harken.</li> </ul> Walkthrough 1st Run (2nd Half Straight to the Duke) <ul> <li>There is a fountain to heal up at before heading to the final room. There are a lot of sentry patrols on this floor, but they can all be avoided by carefully tailing behind them. The statue rooms are not relevant on the 1st run but can be used to hide from the sentries if you get seen. After arriving at the final room, you can begin the GWO fight by interacting with the lever further down from the room.</li> </ul> Walkthrough 2nd Run and onwards (1st Half Zone 9 to Zone 10 to Zone 9) <ol> <li>The Corruption Sentry in this path can be avoided now. You will need to do the puzzle that is initiated by pushing the golem in the room nearby through the wall. There will be a skeleton on the floor that needs to be interacted with, which will then spawn a doll and map on the floor nearby. The map will mark 3 locations on the previous two floors that you will need to backtrack to in order to pick up wind-up keys for the doll automaton. The 3 locations will always be the same regardless of map configuration. After obtaining 3 wind-up keys, return to the doll in the Zone 10 room and interact with it. Afterwards, walk to the tile right outside of the Corruption Sentry's sight.<ul> <li>Zone 9: X:7, Y:12</li> <li>Zone 8: X:4, Y:9 | X:7, Y:19</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>In the room before dropping down to the Corruption Sentry, you can open a different hole with a Golem so you don't get seen. </p> <p></p> </li> </ol> Walkthrough 2nd Run and onwards (2nd Half straight to the Duke) <ul> <li>It's generally the same this time. Depending on which ending run you are there may be different things to do though. You don't need to interact with the Lever this time and can just walk directly to the ramparts of the castle.</li> </ul> Path to boss <p>In order to reach the boss, you must circle around to the other side of the stone pillar and interact with it.

It will generally spam an AOE frontline attack, but can sometimes do a column attack. Very rarely, it will decide to basic attack. Every 4 turns, it will rebuff itself for another 4 turns. When it's about to die, it will buff itself with an accuracy buff and damage buff for 4 turns that isn't as strong as its usual buff. However, the attack buff does not stack with the other attack buff, but the accuracy buffs stack. This golem has around 24k HP and uses Core Activation when it has around 5-6k HP remaining.</p> <p>Boss: Defensive Golem</p> <p>It will buff itself on turn 1 for extremely high defense/magic defense. It also has the same moveset as the Offensive Golem in which it spams an AOE frontline attack or a column attack. It occasionally uses basic attacks. Every 4 turns, it will rebuff itself with the def/mdef buff (despite it having no duration). When it's about to die, it will buff itself with an accuracy buff and damage buff that are very mild for 4 turns. This golem has around 10k HP and uses Core Activation when it has around 2k HP remaining.</p> Saving the Dog and Adventurers <p>If you choose to save both the dog and adventurers at the same time, you will need to fight BOTH, and the def/mdef buff of the defensive golem applies to the offensive golem (but not the other way around for the offensive buff). If you choose to save only either one, you will still need to fight both golems, but one at a time instead.</p> Strategy <p>Strategy: If your team is fast enough, you have 1 turn to burn the golems for as much HP as possible in 1 turn. You need to use defense penetration skills or have relatively high attack preferably using 2h Weapons with enough substats.</p> <p>Once the golems buff, you should have the ninja use dissipation on the offensive golem. You can further reduce their damage by casting Balafeos or smacking the golems with Staff of Weakness.</p> <p>Repeat until both are dead. Use heals as often as possible. It's entirely possible to evade the golems as well with enough evasion (180+) especially if the accuracy buff is dissipated as well (the attack buff is removed first).</p> <p>The defensive golem will likely die first, and the offensive golem will actually remove its invulnerability buff once it reaches near death because of Core Activation. Dissipation still removes the damage buff first. It will still have quite a bit of HP so continue the strategy and only attack when it has 1 turn of accuracy left. </p> <p>It's generally recommended to use 2H for this fight as these golems have very high defense. If you'd like to play it safe, Knight's Defense is an option here to tank 1 turn of undissipated damage. Samurai quickdraw stance here is also very effective as the golems can only cast physical attacks.</p> Additional Notes <ul> <li>If you only save the dog, you get nothing but the stated gold in the request.</li> </ul> Rewards <p>If you save both the dog and the adventurers, you will receive the bondmate \"Eugen and Bibi\" which is a void element bondmate with confusion tolerance.</p>"},{"location":"abyss-guides/3-guarda-fortress/requests/#emergency-occurrence","title":"Emergency Occurrence","text":"Requirements <p>Stopped the Mastermind</p> <p>This request leads to a boss fight that is arguably more difficult than that of the average fight with the GWO of this abyss.</p> <ol> <li>After accepting the quest, head to Edge of Town to receive more information.</li> <li>Head to Zone 3 -Old Secret Passage B3F- and walk slightly north of the Harken.</li> </ol> Enemies <p>Enemies</p> <p></p> <p>Boss: Necrocore</p> <p>This boss will always act three times at the start of the fight.

Try not to use Light element adventurers, as all the damage done by the enemies are Dark. It's very recommended to have Assault guard level 1 on all the frontline (Not necessary if you have multiple light gear)</p> <p>Backline:     Two priests are preferred, especially if at least one of them can cast mage skills (Kantios). They ideally should both have Madios LvL 3+ and Makaltu Lvl 3+. If you do not have a Knight in the frontline OR are using the Knight for DPS purposes only, you WILL need a knight SPECIFICALLY to cast Knight's Defense. Assault Guard is preferred on all the backline as well. (You do not need a knight if you have multiple pieces of light gear)</p> <p>The Knight casting Knight's Defense needs to be slower than all other party members, but still be around ~70 ASPD give or take a few to not be outsped later in the fight by the Necrocore. </p> <p>Generally speaking, you should try to have Light gear (dark resistance) for the boss if normal gear isn't doing enough damage.</p> <p>Strategy:     Essentially, this fight is a DPS race to see whether your team can kill the Necrocore before it wipes your team. The fight will ALWAYS start out as an Ambush, and as such, the Necrocore always gets a free hit on your party. He hits EXTREMELY hard and easily deals 500+ damage on an assault guarded frontline with 300+ defense. It's acceptable to restart if he does Spear Thrust instead of Zelos or Mazelos, as those are not affected by the attack buff he casts. Essentially you will be spamming Full Power Strike on Fighters OR Heavy Attack/Precision Strike/Armor Pierce LVL 3+ every turn on ONLY the Necrocore, as the fight will end once the Necrocore dies. Makaltu will help a lot with surviving the onslaught of damage every turn, as it's quite a lot EVEN with Knight's Defense. Two priests are preferred, as you often will need to cast Madios Lvl 3+ on both rows. When you do not need to heal, attempt to cast Kantios on the back row and then the front row. This will reduce the amount of damage you may take, as most of the basic enemies have Instant Kill moves or skills that deal a lot of AOE damage. It's also preferrable for the support adventurers to carry nourishing draught if you need more turns to deal with the Necrocore.</p> Additional Notes <ul> <li>Dissipation does not work here very well, as the Necrocore rebuffs on turn 5. In addition, the attack buff is dispelled after the accuracy buff, and the defense buff is not dispellable despite being multi-turn.</li> </ul> Rewards <p>You will obtain \"Graham, Knight Commander of Guarda\" as a bondmate, who is a fire element bondmate with Attack Power and Stone Resistance.</p>"},{"location":"abyss-guides/3-guarda-fortress/wandering-npcs/","title":"Wandering NPCs","text":""},{"location":"abyss-guides/3-guarda-fortress/wandering-npcs/#impregnable-fortress-wandering-npc-guide","title":"Impregnable Fortress Wandering NPC Guide","text":"<p>There are a number of characters that wander the Abyss who you may encounter.

Both the MC and enemies that are not detected yet produce these footprints, so these are good indicators of where the enemy is if you cannot see them but hear them.</p> <ol> <li>Head to Royal Capital Adventurer's Guild to receive your faction request of choice.</li> <li>Head over to Valeon Grasslands and walk through all three plains. You'll occasionally encounter some NPC dialogues about Isberg on the way, and eventually get a short briefing from your faction representaive.</li> <li> <p>Deepsnow Hinterlands of Isberg's main town, Winterface Settlement, will not have anything of interest except maybe a cat as the tavern manager. To continue, head to the edge of town and enter the Abyss. You will be introduced to the chill/freezing mechanic along with the main gimmick of this abyss, which are portions of the map that inflict chill per turn and deny use of the minimap and map. Eventually you'll also reach a hot spring that can cleanse you of the chill/freeze debuff. Continue to Route 2.</p> <p>Freeze Mechanic</p> <ul> <li>In applicable areas, snowstorm will take place at the start of turn, immediately applying 10 stacks of chill on every unit on the field (then deducting 2 stacks).</li> <li>When chill reaches 0, applies frozen to the unit.</li> <li>Frozen unit can still act and have increased Defense, but will have greatly reduced ASPD, ACC, and EVA. Frozen units can get shattered, which removes Frozen but inflicts a large amount of damage. Only certain actions can do this (Two-handed weapon actions). Fire actions will immediately clear chill/frozen. Enemies have a chance to break your frozen immediately and cause high damage with any skill, but certain enemy skills can guaranteed inflict heavy damage. For some reason Eruption Strike prioritizes clearing frozen/chill and does not trigger shatter.</li> <li>Snowstorm reduces chill by 2 every turn, while water element skills reduce chill by 3. Some unique enemy skills can immediately reduce chill by large amounts.</li> <li>Hot Springs and Camping can immediately remove all chill/frozen debuffs. Ice-Chipping Hammers are consumables that can also remove chill and freeze from a single unit.</li> <li>Some equipment reduces chill stack reduction.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>While going through Route 2, there will be a few cutscenes foreshadowing the upcoming fight on this floor. Upon reaching the end of the floor, you'll engage in a fight with Bigfoot.</p> Bigfoot <ul> <li>He will start with Empowered by Snowstorm then immediately cast Hip Attack to a random adventurer (Single target attack that also hits adjacent allies in the row). He has two baby bigfoots to his sides.</li> <li>Like with many enemies in this abyss, he will cast skills out of turn when taking a certain amount of damage.</li> <li>When taking a certain amount of damage, he will immediately cast his breath skill. The second time, he will chest pount and summon more baby bigfoots. The third time he will self buff with 10 turns of DEF, MDEF, and ATK up. The ATK is dispelled first.</li> <li>Fire attacks will enrage him and can cause him to immediately cast his breath skill. However, fire attacks used after he self buffs will instead remove all his buffs and cause him to cast an undispellable infinite ATK UP and CT UP buff.</li> <li>If Bigfoot is killed before all the baby bigfoots, the rest will be severely ATK debuffed and CT downed.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Enter Rockhome Village, which is seemingly empty. There is some information that can be obtained in the mayor's house right next to the Harken. If you return to town via the Harken at this point, you will receive the Faction-specific side-quest. You may go complete the request now or later. If later, continue onwards to Route 4.</p> </li> <li> <p>While going through Route 4, you'll be introduced to another gimmick in this abyss, which is the Nullshadow. You also meet Iris, who is a main character for this abyss. She will save you once from the Nullshadow. Continue to Route 5.</p> <p>Nullshadow Mechanic</p> <ul> <li>Whenever in a snowstorm area, there will be a chance the Nullshadow spawns nearby. It is a white ghostly version of the Greater Warped One of this abyss. There will be a sound cue whenever it shows up.</li> <li>It is an unkillable enemy that typically casts Labadios on your team, typically dealing insane amounts of damage that drops HP to 1. If hit again while at 1 HP, it will kill the adventurer.</li> <li>You will need to flee from the fight if you accidentally engage with the Nullshadow, as it's a guaranteed loss. It is very difficult to flee from the fight however, so it's recommended to not get into battle in the first place.</li> <li>When you flee from the fight or leave the snowstorm area, it will despawn.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>While going through Route 5, you will eventually get caught by the Nullshadow again. You will be stuck in a looping room with various spawned enemies and the Nullshadow. However, your character is getting very sleepy and the situation looks very dire. Lulunarde will mention how the snowstorm is making things very difficult and that it has something to do with trees blocking the wind. This scripted scenario will have your character constantly falling over and Lulunarde constantly waking you up. This scenario is similar to the drowning scenario in Abyss 2, where you will learn the Cursed Hand Technique for the Abyss in order to survive. There will be a tree stump in the center of the small room, where you must tap on it to revive the tree and stop the snowstorm. When the snowstorm subsides, the Nullshadow will also despawn. Proceed to Route 6.</p> </li> <li> <p>During your trek through Route 6, you will notice a lot of berry bushes that cannot be interacted with. It's ideal to note their location (or just look at the provided map). Upon going further, you'll eventually officially meet Iris, who is reluctant to talk to you. Upon exhausting the dialogue options, you'll be tasked with helping her collect snowberries. Return to all the snowberry bushes indicated and pick them. Each bush randomly can either give you a snowberry, give a half-eaten one, or trigger a fight. There will a fight where the snowberry is on the floor nearby, and another where the fight gives a snowberry directly. Upon gathering enough, head back and turn in the snowberries to Iris to gain her trust. As you continue towards the mine however, you'll eventually by surrounded by wolves. You'll need to kill the head wolf to progress.</p> Snow Wolf Leader <ul> <li>The fight has several other snow wolves in the same row and behind. The snow wolves are significantly weaker than the leader.</li> <li>The wolves can summon another wolf into the fight, while the leader can summon multiple into the fight.</li> <li>The leader can use an ice breath that immediately freezes a row. He can also summon an ice storm that also freezes everyone including his own units and himself in the battle.</li> <li>When the leader is frozen AND there are 6 or more wolves on the field, he can cast Glacial Storm which is a full team AOE that does a lot of damage.

This is to get you to kill the children by accident. It's highly recommended to not have low fortitude when attempting. Alternatively, you can have two priests casting Makalki on each row every other turn if applicable.</li> <li>He can cast Labadios and use a skill that inflicts bleed.</li> <li>He can occasionally cast Maporfic (really strong makaltu) on everyone, so have dissipation.</li> <li>He has around ~15k HP.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>After defeating him, he will consume all the children and become powered up.

Approaching the cabin has Lulunarde suggesting that we need to deal with the adults before heading towards defeating Godefroi.</li> <li>You need to head to Route 3's Rockhome Village. Walking towards the Mayor's house from the harken will show that the town is trapped. Head towards the house at the bottom middle of the map to find Mike. He will attempt to defend himself with goblins, which end up turning on him. You will have to fight three goblins. After winning, Lulunarde will name 3 more locations that adults may be at. You can visit any of these points in any order that you want.</li> <li>Route 4's Snowy Road to the Mine requires you to head towards the middle of the map. You will notice a cart with rocks on it. Interact with it and turn around to find one of the adults. He will lock you in and then throw meat to lure monsters to deal with you. Head slightly south to find him again and you may choose any option to deal with him.</li> </ol> <p>All the adults in which you fight in combat have the capacity to run away if you take too long with the overall battle, even if you killed them first. This will ruin your progress for the section.</p> <ol> <li>Route 7's Depleted Mine 1F requires you to teleport to the harken and then head to the staircase at the bottom right. Taking a few steps forwards will activate a rockfall trap that also spawns poison cloud tiles around you. Reverse the rockfall trap if you wish and move towards the NPC icon on the map to find Lucas. He will then gas the whole room and release numerous enemies in the room and corridor outside. Walk slightly up to find him again and start a fight. There will be 3 baby bigfoots in the front row, with him and a Bigfoot in the back row. Defeat him and deal with him however you choose.</li> <li>Route 6's South Lakeshore adult, Otto, will initially be located at X:14, Y:11. He will run away to X:11, Y:2. He will run away again to X:5, Y:1. Then finally, he will run away to X:1, Y:17. It will be a fight with several snow hawks, big snow hawks, and himself. If you do not kill all enemies quickly he will escape the fight regardless of what order kills are done, and he can flee even if killed first.  All actions count for this fight, both enemy and yours, if too many actions occur he will flee.  Many of the birds will use their first round free actions to buff themselves with accellarate.  It is critical this buff be removed ASAP to reduce enemy actions, mages are very strong here as Maelefic Wind can do damage and remove accellarate at the same time.  Ideally you also want to enter this fight with no chill stacks to reduce risk of being frozen by the birds with bad RNG.   </li> <li>Route 9's North Lakeshore adult is the Mayor and he is located at X:15, Y:15. He is surrounded by many packs of Snow Wolves + a Snow Wolf Leader. He will then run away to the nearby cabin south. You will need to fight your way to him and then fight the pack defending the door.

Hence why to destroy the ice pillars.</li> <li>He can re-summon the ice pillars after a certain number of turns.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>After defeating Godefroi, Iris will come running in and be extremely sad that the priest is dead. Lulunarde suggests looking around the church to find the source of canary crystals. You head to the well and find out that there is a torture chamber that was being used to turn children into canary crystals. The only way forward is blocked by a nullstone, so you leave only to be confronted by Iris. Her extreme sadness causes her to transmute into a canary crystal herself that covers the well. You gain knowledge that this crystallization effect is due to a powerful Wizardry effect like your Right Hand of Reversal and therefore cannot be affected by it. You are able to break off a part of her crystal and turn it in at the Royal Capital to complete the request.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"abyss-guides/4-isberg/important-request-gwo/#saving-iris","title":"Saving Iris","text":"<p>You feel that if you do everything correctly, you can also save Iris from her fate.</p> <ol> <li>Cursed Wheel to Short Rest in the Cabin with the cabin fixed and adults secured. From this point, teleport to Route 3's Rockhome Village. Head to Iris's House at the middle right of the map. There will be two nullstones in there. Exhaust all options in there and gain the idea to possibly try reversing the nullstone. It ends up working and you can the knowledge to do so on all nullstones. Reverse both parents, attempt to open the trapdoor on the floor, attempt to push the nullstone, and then head to Route 9's North Lakeshore to find Iris waiting outside of the cabin. Ask her if she wants to see her parents. Return to her house and the nullstone covering the trapdoor will walk off of it. Head down to the basement altar and interact with everything down there. You will learn that it is possible to cure Iris's vision, as it may allow her to truly see what the Greater Warped One looks like.</li> <li> <p>You will need Creeping Crud Ichor and Glitterstone Ore. Head to Route 7 via Route 6's Harken and walk upwards. You will see a stationary green enemy icon in a nearby room, which will drop the ichor. The exact coordinates for this enemy is X:16, Y:6. Leave and then head to Route 8 via Route 7's Harken and the bottom right staircase. Glitterstone Ore will be located at the top right or bottom left of the map (it will be a 2x2 room with a 1 square protrusion). It's recommended to kill all the enemies on the way there as Glitterstone Ore is very fragile and will break if you take too much damage in battles.</p> <p>Glitterstone Ore Location</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Head back to Iris's House and bring her with you. Herbalist's Shrine will unlock on the world map. You will need to head there. Head into the dungeon and find the Herbalist in a nearby room. She will need you to fetch some water in the shrine. The water will be located at the top left of the map. Upon reaching the water, you will have to fight a Lizardman Champion with some Sahuagin. Like many other enemies in this abyss, he can cast typical Lizardman Champion skills out of turn when he takes enough damage. All of these skills do extremely high amounts of physical damage so be prepared.</p> </li> <li>Return to the Herbalist and watch a cutscene of Iris regaining her eyesight. You can now head to the church and defeat Godefroi. Skip Route 10 via cursed wheel with the eye fixed option.</li> <li> <p>When confronting Godefroi, it seems that Iris still believes that the priest's soul is still there. She understands that you must defeat the demon that is confining the priest.</p> Godefroi True End Fight <ul> <li>The final fight is unique in that he has multiple HP pools (roughly 4-5 at 10-12.5K HP each). Total HP is roughly ~50K. This is one of the key reasons to not push damage too quickly as it is possible to \"overkill\" a single HP pool and prompt his hard-hitting out-of-turn actions. </li> <li>Kill ice pillars ASAP (LA- spells are good) they have ~1000 hp. These increase physical dmg reduction of all units on the field by an insane amount + cast chill on the entire team. For reference, ~510 magic power + lvl 2 Lahalito is enough to kill all of them in 1 turn. Physical attacks work as well, but require a lot of attack and high skill level.</li> <li>Kill ghost kids QUICKLY (within 3 turns), they only have ~600 hp and are immune (1 dmg at most) to physical attacks. if they are not killed they will be consumed in 3 turns to give him an undispellable insanely high damage buff. They are also immune to marein. For reference, ~410 magic power + lvl 1 malefic wind is enough to kill them.</li> <li>Dissipate his damage reduction buff (Maporfic) ASAP, otherwise he takes 0 physical dmg. He always casts Maporfic as first action.</li> <li>If you get frozen, he will be more likely to attack the frozen unit with a physical skill and instant kill them. As such, dumping damage on him is not recommended. </li> <li>He either has hp thresholds per phase (he doesnt take damage past an amount per hidden phase) or has some strange hp mechanic.</li> <li>He may counter with Madalto or Labadios every time he takes a certain amount of damage.</li> <li>After 2-3 turns he will resummon the ghost kids, can prepare beforehand with mental unity. </li> <li>It is recommended to have at least 2 healing capable users and 2 AOE magic users.</li> <li>A knight with knight's defense + synced ASPD helps survive dubious rounds.</li> <li>Very very resistant to debuffs (in most cases just straight up immune).</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>After defeating him. Follow Iris to the well. Reverse the nullstone blocking the way previously and head deep into the well. You will find the priest's remains crystallized with several children. You learn that the crystallization was the priest's own Wizardry magic that he used to reduce the suffering of children. After reversing his body, you experience his human memories and watch his body fade away. You can pick up a Godefroi Holy Relic on the floor. Head to the purple crystal in the back and exhaust both options. Iris insists that you take part of the canary crystal. When you exit the well, Iris musters the courage to push on ahead by herself, and you will receive her as a bondmate. You can now return to the Royal Capital and turn in the request.

The player can collect Tallow of Bone Summoning for free from the Furnace of Deathsmoke (on the Mausoleum floor selection screen) and from the Abyss wandering Bone Collector (purchased for 10,000gp).  Each can be obtained once every 7 days.  </p> <p> </p> <p>By using two Tallows at an Altar of Morgus, the number of claimed bones in that Mausoleum can be reduced by one. This means that a previously 'emptied' Mausoleum could then produce one extra (random) Adventurer from that Mausoleum's list.  Other than the consumed Tallow, there is no other cost to doing this, and it is ecouraged to be done regularly as it increases the game's otherwise limited bone resource.  There are strategy suggestions to use this to maximum advantage below.</p> <p> </p> Altar of Morgus: God of Death's Favor <p>  The one bone per visit limit can be increased by making a sacrifice of 100 Gems at the Altar of Morgus.  After paying the Gems, a one hour countdown will begin during which time you will be allowed to open up to three doors per visit to the Mausoleum before the remaining doors lock. You can leave and re-enter the mausoleum as many times as you want during that hour, opening up to three chests each time. Note the warning though, that the number of enemies, including wandering necrocores, is increased. Because there is no limitation on simply leaving and reentering the Mausoleum, this is considered a rather low-value use of Gems and is discouraged.</p> Mausoleum Guide Protection <ul> <li>The Mausoleum Guide offers to accompany you through the Mausoleum for 100 Gems to protect against the increased danger from undead Insta-kill attacks. During combat, the guide will intercept any Insta-kill attacks from undead (and rascally rabbits). If the attack lands, the Guide will be killed instead of your Adventurer. Otherwise the Guide will act as a mid-level fire mage battle companion, often casting Halito, Mahalito, Katino, and other debuff spells on the enemy.  </li> <li>Once protection is purchased, the Guide will remain a Mausoleum battle companion indefinitely until killed, even over multiple trips to the Mausoleum.  Because of the persistence and ability to mitigate some of the Mausoleum's increased combat danger, the value of this protection can be considered either a good or poor investement according to your risk tolerance.  </li> </ul>"},{"location":"abyss-guides/ancient-mausoleum/maps/#mausoleum-strategies","title":"Mausoleum Strategies","text":"Combat Tips <ul> <li>Map layout and enemy spawn points do not change.  While a few fights are unavoidable on the path to the chest rooms, most can be waited for and avoided if necessary.  </li> <li>It's recommended to bring undead-bane weapons. High Action Speed will help you go first and kill undead before they get off any insta-kill attacks. Evasion is also a very good stat to have for dodging those instant-kill attacks that get through.</li> <li>Necrocores - undead centaurs -  can be found patrolling right by the chest rooms.  They are the only \"large bear shaped\" wandering enemy. Avoiding those at lower level is strongly advised.  </li> <li>Marein for priests can instantly kill the most dangerous enemies (who also all tend to stand in rows).  </li> <li>Any Insta-Kill Tolerance items, Malice Helm, Well of Mind Bonuses, etc., can help. Galina improves Instant-kill resistance for adjacent evil characters.  </li> <li>Mustiple casters with row or group damage spells that don't suffer from unhead resistance can significantly improve your survival chances. </li> <li>Some peolpe appreciate the peace of mind that comes from paying the Mausoleum Guide to accompany you and intercept any insta-kills that slip through.  That includes rabbits.</li> </ul> Bone Tallow <p>2 bone tallows lets you get another bone from a selected class Mausoleum once per week.  Because bones are randomly chosen from the availability list, there's no way of knowing if you'll get a character you actually want. But, you can take some time to play the statistics a bit to maximize the liklihood of getting a character you want:</p> <p>adapted from Efficient usage of Tallow of Bone Summoning - by BeautifulDemise </p> <ul> <li>Strategy 1: Simply use the tallows on a Mausoleum with a character you want, then get the bone right away and see if you get that character.  E.g., if you want a Dino (to increase your Montino level), use the tallows in the Mage Mausoleum, and you'll have a 1/4 = 25% chance of getting the mage you want.  Do this every week and you're chance of getting at least 1 Dino in N weeks is P(N) = 1 - 0.75^N. (68% likelihood over 4 weeks of getting 1 Dino).</li> <li>Strategy 2: Guarantee you get a Dino by using Tallows until you completely reset the Mage Mausoleum (all 4 Mages), then go get all 4 bones. After four weeks you'll have a 4/4 =  100% chance of getting 1 Dino, with a 'success rate' of 25% (1 Dino, 3 not).</li> <li>Strategy 3: You probably want more than one Dino (level 3 Montino will take 4 Dino copies), and want increased chances of getting him and not the others. You can do that by first following the Strategy 2 approach of resetting the whole Mausoleum to 0 (0/4 for Mages). Then, retrieve bones until you get Dino. At that point stop getting bones. Reset the Mage Mausoleum to 0 again. Then get bones again until you get Dino. Stop. Reset. Repeat.  At the best case you get Dino on the first run.  At the worst case, you repeat the Strategy 2 exercise and it takes 4 runs to get what you want.  You are still guaranteed a 100% chance of getting Dino in 4 runs or less. By resetting right after a success, though, you average fewer unwanted bones (see link above for maths) and will have a higher success rate of 40% in the long run (4 Dino's in 10) versus the Strategy 2 of 25%.</li> <li>Strategy 3.5: You can apply Strategy 3 when you want more than one bone in a Mausoleum. Maybe both Dino and Asha for MONTINO and KATINO, or Jean and Bakesh for their trap skills (2 of 6 from Thief Mausoleum).  In that case you run until you get the two you want, then reset.  Similar math applies, and the success rate will be higher than Strategy 1 or 2.  You can even get really fancy, and maybe you wouldn't mind Amelia's Stealth skill and value it ~half as much as trap skills.  You can use the 'liklihood of success' change as you collect bones to decide when to reset and incease overall success rate. Again, see math linked above. </li> </ul> Mausoleum Speed Running <p>Mausoleum enemies can be dangereous for lower level parties, and the fast movement of auto-walking increases chance of accidental ambushes when running into enemies. If you aren't confident of surviving ambushes, you're advise to just walk the path and make deliberate choices to trigger/ambush/avoid the enemies.</p> <ul> <li>After much trial and error, the path shown on the 'Suggested' map below seems to be the fastest.  By speedwalking that route you can often encounter only 1 'can't dodge' combat, and often even miss any chest room bosses. </li> <li>As of Jan 2025 update the auto-walk and map behavior has changed. Previously, in addition to whole map tiles being covered, the map would always reset and fill as if it was being explored anew.  Now the tiles still stay covered until you enter them, but the map remembers previousl exploration. This lets you set persistent and see chests. More importantly, they added 'navigate to nearest check/chest' functions, and auto-walking persists after encountering combats and chests.  </li> <li>The speedwalk map below has been updated with checkmarks that can be set on the mausoluem map. After setting these checks, on all subsequent visits you can enter the mausoleum, tap 'auto-walk to check' three times, and it will run you along the 'fastest' path right to the chest. Then tap 'auto-walk to exit' and you're out.  Rinse and repeat until you've gotten all your bones.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"abyss-guides/ancient-mausoleum/maps/#maps","title":"Maps","text":"<p>Ancient Mausoleum</p> <p> </p> <p>Mausoleum of Guidance</p> <p> </p> <p>Suggested Fast Chest Path with Minimal Fight Potential</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"abyss-guides/ancient-mausoleum/maps/#credits","title":"Credits","text":"<p>Ancient Mausoleum map provided by Ogarith.

Note past trial-and-error has suggested the bosses have a higher 'good chest' outcome with better rates of good treasure.  If just farming for highest chest count, you should set a check mark on the bosses, auto-move to chests, then auto move to the bosses, then leave and repeat.  If the bosses are too challenging, then you can just chest dive and leave.</p> <p>Den of Earth Maps</p> <p>The Earth Den is a 2x3 map.

Eventually, you will have fully explored every tile variation, and the map will be fully revealed to you each time you enter.

None that sprung traps are permanently revealed, and should be avoiding from that point on as long as 'avoid traps' is selected in your auto-move settings.  Note that there are far fewer traps here than in the Earth Den and none need to be crossed to reach the bosses, but chests may appear in areas inaccessible without crossing them.</p> <p>The bosses are on the top center tile, and the tiles are constructed such that direct boss-rush routes will never take you on the two eastern tiles. The tileset draw will dicate which path is open.  If you have not yet fully explored the tiles, you can look at the revealed walls of tiles adjoining the boss tile. The only tileset found where you cannot enter from the west has a only 1-square wide passage to a deadend, and the only tileset found where you cannot enter from the south has no openings.  So as long as you see a three-square wide opening to either the west or the south from the exit tile, that way should be open to you. Once you've explored the tilesets, though, you can just set check marks on the bosses, auto-move to chests, then auto move to the bosses, then leave and repeat.

Grade tag items may be obtained in various ways.</p> <p>Grade Exams may have additional requirements besides reaching the necessary level. Requirements like completing more guild requests (to 'increase your reputation') may be needed. Arna may mention these. In these situations, adventurers should try to complete as many different requests as possible.</p> <p>Adventures can only attempt a Grade Exam as high as the MC has attained. However, unlike the MC, they do not need to complete every grade exam in order and may simply complete the latest grade exam available (e.g., If the MC is level 60 already, and a fresh level 1 adventurer on the team completes the level 60 exam with the help of other team members, that level 1 adventurer will receive permission to grade up at every level 10 interval starting at lvl 20 without having to complete the previous exams.)

The former increases base traits while the latter increases derived stats such as Attack Power, Accuracy, Evade, and so on.</li> <li>Each stat bondmate increases a specific, fixed trait. For example, Abenius only increases STR and you will never recieve a stat bondmate copy of her that increases another trait like DEX or IQ.</li> <li>Stat bondmates range from level 1 to 5. Unlike story bondmates it is possible to have multiple copies of the same stat bondmate. </li> <li>Stat bondmates are equipped in the Training Room under the Bondmates sub-menu and are included in the Bondmate List. </li> </ul> Flaming-Heart Requirements ConditionsTroubleshootingFlaming-Heart IconStat Bondmate Example <ul> <li>The goal of this process is to get the flaming-heart icon on a unit, so that they can be dismissed and turned into a stat bondmate. There are 3 requirements:</li> <li>Bronze Grade (minimum level of 30)<ul> <li>Raising the unit's level beyond this point does not do anything aside from refunding their higher-tier Grade tag if taken to level 40 (Iron) or above. Higher levels have no effect on your chances of getting a level 5 bondmate. </li> </ul> </li> <li>Defeat Helmut and either Melgina or Octoranus<ul> <li>The game treats Melgina or Octoranus as the \"same\" Greater Warped One (GWO), so you cannot double-dip.</li> <li>Melgina is safer and faster to defeat with low-level units.</li> <li>The unit does not need to survive the fight; however, it is preferrable to avoid the trust penalty from dying.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Trust farm via Camping in Abyss 1, Floor 7 until the flaming-heart appears.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Do the conditions in the order listed. </li> <li>The primary reason why people do not get the flaming-heart is because they begin trust farming prior to defeating the two GWOs (Helmut, Melgina or Octoranus). </li> <li>If you have been trust farming for more than 30 minutes, then double-check:<ul> <li>Unit is Bronze grade</li> <li>The 2 GWO fights are completed</li> <li>The unit did not die repeatedly while leveling them.</li> </ul> </li> <li>There are very rare instances where a Nameless unit will just not proc the flaming-heart icon even after excessive trust grinding. This tends to happen with Good or Neutral MC and Evil units the most frequently. We suspect that each unit has a starting trust value range that is RNG-based and determined at creation. Some units can start with extremely low trust making them difficult to raise. In some cases it is just best to dismiss for their Grade tag. </li> </ul> Bondmate Levels <ul> <li>After dismissal the stat bondmate will receive a level from 1 to 5. It seems to be based on the level of the bondmates attached to it prior to dismisal. It is a mechanic that is not fully understood to-date. </li> <li>Based on extensive community testing we can confirm:<ul> <li>If a unit has two, level 5 bondmates attached prior to dismissal it will result in a level 4 or 5 stat bondmate.</li> <li>The odds of either are effectively ~50%. There is no known, consistent way to guarantee a level 5.</li> </ul> </li> <li>In practice, this means that for whatever number of level 5 bondmates you are targeting you will need to farm double that target. For example, if you want a level 5 SPD bondmate on 6 units you should expect to farm, on average, 12 SPD bondmates.</li> <li>Note that the bondmates attached to the dismissed unit are not lost, but are returned to the Bondmate List.</li> </ul> Trait Bonuses MechanicsExample: Level 5 Stat BondmateExample: Level 4 Stat Bondmate <ul> <li>The trait bonus from the stat bondmate is a function of both the Grade of the adventurer being equipped and the level of the bondmate.

For example, Neutral MC and Yekaterina (Neutral) will earn more trust points than Neutral MC and Milana (Evil) even if you provided the \"best\" response to both.</li> <li>Few-to-no trust points are earned with Good-Evil pairings. </li> </ul> <ul> <li>Other adventurers present during Tavern or Camp conversations gain a small amount of trust even if they are not directly participating. </li> <li>For example, if Good MC and Lana (Good) had a conversation with the \"best\" response selected, then:<ul> <li>Lana (Good) = Maximum amount of trust points</li> <li>Abenius (Good) = Small amount of trust points</li> <li>Yekaterina (Neutral) = Small amount of trust points, but fewer than Abenius</li> <li>Milana (Evil) = 0 trust points </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul> <li>Battles provide an extremely small amount of trust. It requires 100+ battles before you begin to see pips added to the Compendium. It is unknown whether a character needs to be present or take an action during combat to earn trust points. </li> <li>The death of a stat bondmate comes with a significant trust penalty. It should be avoided at all costs while leveling or during the GWO fights. <ul> <li>Same alignment as MC = 1-3 additional Camp conversations</li> <li>Different alignment = 2-5 additional Camp conversations</li> </ul> </li> <li>If a stat bondmate dies, then make sure the MC dies during the revival mini-game. The \"Rise again\" or \"Accept death\" options will negate any trust loss.</li> <li>If you have access to the Martial Training (Guarda Fortress) dispatch this is a safe alternative to manually leveling.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Neutral MC is the optimal alignment when stat bondmate farming.</li> <li>Trust farming should be done with same-alignment parties only when possible. </li> <li>Lana (Good), Yekaterina (Neutral), and Alice (Evil) are excellent companions to bring along as they will frequently proc camp conversations.</li> <li>This process can be tag-intensive. Remember that you are refunded a Bronze tag at the end of this process, but you cannot downgrade tags!</li> </ul> Nameless Adventurers Why Nameless?Nameless BasicsTrait BonusesAlternative Options <ul> <li>Always use Nameless adventurers (Human Fighter, Elf Mage, etc.) as they have lower trust requirements for a flaming-heart than their General or Legendary counterparts.</li> <li>General or Legendary adventurers can take 2-3x as long to reach flaming-heart status even if their alignment matches the MC. They also give the same trait bonus amounts as Nameless.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Cannot join Tavern conversations, but are present during Camp conversations. This is the key to efficient stat bondmate farming.</li> <li>Receive \"spill over\" trust points from Camp conversations from adventurer's with the same alignment.</li> <li>Nameless that share the MC's alignment receive an additional trust boost and require few-to-no Camp conversations. <ul> <li>90% of the time they will receive a flaming-heart after defeating the second GWO - as long as they did not die at any point during the battle or while leveling.</li> <li>If they do not instantly receive the flaming-heart, then it usually requires 1-2 Camp conversations.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Putting all BP into SPD is recommended to ensure the stat bondmates can move before Melgina/Octo to defend against their attacks.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>STR - Human Fighter (Neutral)</li> <li>DEX - Beast Thief (Evil) </li> <li>IQ - Elf Mage (Neutral)</li> <li>SPD - Human Ninja (Evil)</li> <li>VIT - Dwarf Knight (Neutral) </li> <li>PIE - Human Priest (Good), Elf Priest (Evil)</li> <li>LCK - No unit - Nameless, General, or Legendary - gives Luck as a trait bonus</li> </ul> <ul> <li>The only General units you may want to consider using are Philip (Neutral) and Viviana (Evil) for SPD. </li> <li>The Human-Ninja (Evil) requires 830K EXP to reach level 30 versus 330K EXP for Philip and Viviana. </li> <li>The trade-off is that Philip's inherit, Delay Attack, can be very useful if using speed strategies in conjunction with MC Chrono 1-2, Batilgref, and Porto. The latter two can be stacked using a spell and shop scroll.  </li> <li>Viviana's inherit, Hiding, is no longer as attractive as it used to be, but she is one of the more difficult characters to build trust with if you are not using an Evil MC.  </li> </ul> Trust Farming Process <ul> <li>Ensure that every unit (besides the MC) shares the same alignment as the stat bondmate. </li> <li>It is most efficient to raise two different stat bondmates of the same alignment simultaneously.<ul> <li>Neutral: Human Fighter (STR) and Elf Mage (IQ) </li> <li>Evil: Beast Thief (DEX), Human Ninja (SPD), Elf Priest (PIE)</li> <li>Good: Human Priest (PIE), Dwarf Knight (VIT)</li> </ul> </li> <li>Go to the Beginning Abyss, Floor 7 </li> <li>Find a chest and have MC (ideally) fail the mini-game.<ul> <li>It is not known if failing chests results in a trust penalty, but it does lower the MC's hidden Fortitude value. </li> <li>There is a fixed mimic chest on F6 by the stairs that you can fail and run away from the battle; this can be repeated.

The change to her unique skill from <code>Water Formation</code> to <code>Grace of the Great Tree</code> is arguably a downgrade. <code>Grace of the Great Tree</code> will give Flut a minor boost to her Magic Power and Defense, however losing the <code>Water Formation</code> buff could have implications later in the game if single element parties become more widespread.</p> <p>As of her release, <code>Water Formation</code> can already be utilized by having a back row of Flut, Alice, and either Philip or Viviana. If Alice was made into a mage, the <code>Water Formation</code> damage boost for her would already surpass the personal damage boost that Flut would gain from <code>Grace of the Great Tree</code>. This is arguably a negligible gain currently due to the lack of any difficult Fire-type content, however the moment that content gets released, <code>Water Formation</code> has the potential to be much more valuable than <code>Grace of the Great Tree</code>. Furthermore, <code>Grace of the Great Tree</code> is a boost when she has a two-handed staff equipped, which completely contrasts with one of her two possible classes. You'd currently never have one equipped if you changed her class to run her as a Warrior.</p> <p>As far as <code>Gift of Spell Genius</code> goes, this is another arguably downgrade to <code>Young Spell Prodigy</code> due to Gift no longer providing an increased Magic Power boost at higher Discipline levels.</p> <p>In terms of role competition, Flut is already surpassed by Mage Alice in terms of utility, so unless you're already running Flut in your party, there's nothing overly enticing about her Mage of the Silent Night kit that would make me consider adding her.</p> <p>Lastly, if you're interested in her strictly for her appearance, everyone will be getting a free <code>Remains of the Mage Praying on the Silent Night</code> bone on Day 6 of the Sacred Feast Special Supplies.</p> <p>Ultimately, this is the first banner the game has introduced that I recommend completely ignoring, as there is essentially zero incentive to use her over standard Flut.</p> TheAxolotl's Pull Plan <p>I got a free copy and that was it.

This time it\u2019s an evil one though. Looking at how many evil front options we have as for now it\u2019s a great choice to pick her in your team if you have a slot just for this.</p> <p>Moving to her discipline. It helps a bit with her bulk and can save you up to a whole 2 more ASPD! Which\u2026 is nothing-by itself alone. But on the bright side her both inheritances are quite useless so it\u2019s worth it to discipline her because you\u2019re losing grade tags in the worst case. </p> <p>Her class change is a mage. And that\u2019s where the fun begins. Miliana as a dark-elf-female has the perfect setup to be a mage. Which means she\u2019s one of best backlane choices to buff further your Gerulf/Galbados or whoever you use. </p> <p>To sum it up. We have access to dark elf mage which is great for later parts of the game. On top of all while her SPD buffs are small she benefits from not only thief passive and discipline but also access to Arboris buff in back row. While those are small things it all adds up making her speed tuning slightly easier. On top of all she's a great option to bring to boss fights because while she\u2019s not as good as Alice she\u2019s still your second best option if you\u2019re not using Madam buff. Not only will she buff your evil ally while having a perfect mage setup like Sheli. But on top of that you\u2019re not risking that she\u2019ll get hit with sleep status in a really long fight. Which makes her safer and better. If you\u2019re looking for a general adventurer for your evil party then Milana is your pick! You can\u2019t go wrong with her there. Her only downside is lack of access to priest class. But that won\u2019t be an issue if you run Alice and Arobis along in the backlane.</p> <p>Ok, this one is a sidegrade. Neither better or worse than the base version. But might bring more or less value depending on the scenario.</p> <p>Firstly It\u2019s physical dmg reduction that works for her and the unit in front/back. Which makes it by default better than summer Yekaterina passive that work only on Yeka and backrow. Unlike physical attacks that aim only for backrow on character that doesn\u2019t take dmg anyway and when she does it\u2019s almost always magical, Milana can buff your squishy frontline character as long as it\u2019s evil (f.e Rinne). Or Milana can be stuck in front as a thief and buff your Alice survivability if for some reason you need it. </p> <p>The overall Milana alter version is a really nice example of how to give alternative options without directly making them better or worse. On top of it her inheritance is precision strike which alone brings value. So for me it\u2019s an alternative done right that's a really solid option on physical enemies that target your front (Guarda GWO, Lizardman from cave, Necrocore superboss etc.) when you need survivability over damage increase.</p>"},{"location":"adventurers/general-adventurers/details/Olive/","title":"Olive","text":""},{"location":"adventurers/general-adventurers/details/Olive/#olive","title":"Olive","text":""},{"location":"adventurers/general-adventurers/details/Olive/#basic-info","title":"Basic Info:","text":"<p>Rarity: General Race: Elf Gender: Female Type: Air Personality: Neutral Starting Class: Fighter Class Change: Thief  </p>"},{"location":"adventurers/general-adventurers/details/Olive/#base-traits","title":"Base Traits","text":"Class: FighterClass: Thief Strength IQ Piety Vitality Dexterity Speed Luck 11 15 11 10 15 15 10 Strength IQ Piety Vitality Dexterity Speed Luck 9 15 11 9 15 17 11 Portraits FighterThief"},{"location":"adventurers/general-adventurers/details/Olive/#skills","title":"Skills","text":"<p>Inheritable Skill</p> Will to Fight  <p>Increases Accuracy, Evasion, and Surety when HP is below a certain level.

Being a Fighter, she gains access to the highest Strength -&gt; Attack Power conversion, on top of some solid damage multipliers and Full-Power Strike. Furthermore, she gains Attack Power with her Discipline levels, which is great.</p> <p>The passive damage boost from her Flickering Fang skill appears to be roughly in the 20% ballpark, although we're still testing out slayer sill damage. This has the potential to be a solid damage increase for her given how frequently we run into magical beasts. The big difference between this and something like a damage boost to Entites or Undead is that the latter start out with innate resistance to physical weapons, while the former doesn't. In many cases, this could end up as a \"kill harder\" bonus where the damage boost is effectively wasted because you already would have done enough damage to the enemy. It'll definitely be more valuable against magical beast bosses, though. Unfortunately, this skill only boosts her own damage and does not extend to party members.</p> <p>Her Flutterdream Flash skill is extremely unique and fun. It's a \"Minor physical attack\" that has enough potency to outright kill a weaker enemy at the start of battle or to take out a nice chunk of health. In addition, the accuracy debuff can be very handy, especially when stacked with something like DILTO. It's unfortunate that this skill is only one use per fight. Abenius will always trigger this skill at the start of the battle unless the battle starts with an ambush, however when inherited to another adventurer, the activation rate and damage drops significantly (roughly 20% on the activation and damage is reduced to roughly 60% of a basic attack). Note that skill inheritance increases the damage of the skill, as well as the amount of accuracy reduced, but it does not increase activation rate or the chance to trigger the accuracy reduction.</p> <p>Abenius' class change of a Priest may seem like an odd one at first glance, but it's worth dipping into for some added buff support on top of gaining Priest Weapon Mastery for a minor passive Attack Power increase. Given that we now have seen katanas with Attack Power and Magic Power on them, it's not outside of the realm of possibility that we'll get future weapons with Attack Power and Divine Power, which would be a perfect fit for Abenius to use.</p> <p>One of the things I really like about Abenius is that her signature skill does not lose value as additional skills get released in the future due to its nature of being an automatic trigger at the start of battle and not an active skill that could become easily powercrept by future active skills (I'm looking at you, Gerard).</p> Frobro's Analysis <p>Certainly more interesting than most other figures. For starters, Like Yekaterina, Abenius has been extremely lucky with the kinds of enemies and events that have been common in the game from Abyss 2 to 3. Abenius does extra damage and receives reduced damage from solid chunk of common enemies thanks to her, Magical Beast-slayer passive. This feels even stronger with the ease of farming and crafting the perfect Horned Eagle Sword from Fordraig.</p> <p>Flutterdream Flash may seem low impact in a vacuum, but if you stop and realize that it is a guaranteed turn 0 hit in every single non-ambush battle, you notice that Abenius likely has done more lifetime damage of most units in the game. I understand the hesitation, but this is a solid use for Codexes assuming you use Abenius often. You\u2019ll get your money\u2019s worth from it so to speak.</p> <p>The discipline is cool, it seems like with the release of abyss 3, going forward we can expect to see more enemies use status ailments against us. Being resistant to 2 of the more debilitating statuses for physical attackers (Charm/Confuse) while getting more attack comes off as better than most. </p> <p>Simple but effective. Not exactly flashy, but still one of the best fighters in the game.</p> Shiro's Analysis <p>Starting from her inheritance we have basically free attack on the enemy. While in case of harder enemies/bosses the impact is quite small and rarely will make a difference (assuming it\u2019s not leveled) the case is different if we got for all around dungeon clear or for farming purposes. In those cases it's a good push towards faster fights. Whenever it kills one of the enemies in the group or slightly weakens a stronger one doing not only damage but also giving him ACC debuff. In the end it's a really good skill for self inheritance but not so good on others because of lowered activation rate.</p> <p>Moving on to her passive, it's a really amazing one especially for second abyss/middle floors of third abyss or both Le Bicken and Hundredfold Blossom caves. Not only does her passive buff her damage vs Magical Beast but also reduces damage received from them. Lucky for her those are really common enemy types so she\u2019ll have a good bunch of time to shine.</p> <p>Moving to her discipline. While in the earlier phase of the game I was really skeptical of her and Lana's, it turned out to be a really good one as we arrive in abyss 3 and we have quite a few enemies that tend to proc charm/confusion. And those are one of the most annoying statuses. It\u2019s one of rare cases where I\u2019d say that it\u2019s worth going for a disc. </p> <p>Her class change is priest, which is one of my favorite options for fighter class. Having it saved me really many times against annoying statuses from enemies like vampire/succubus/gorgon. Not only is it good for cleanse and sometimes emergency healing (assuming you carry staff and you\u2019re not too lazy to swap weapons). But it\u2019s also a good potential for faster fight setup on bosses giving you more buffers in a team and speeding up for example porto on everyone. Overall very solid class change for supportive reasons. On top of it Priest Weapon Mastery helps a bit with attack.</p> <p>To sum it up I believe that Abenius is one of best options when it comes for a fighter (and the best one for general content) thanks to having overall really solid class options, unique passive, inheritance and discipline. I would personally invest in inheritance firstly because it\u2019ll be useful in more situations than more charm/conf resistance but in the end it's a matter of personal opinion on what you find best. Her only downgrade is that her unique doesn\u2019t active on ambush. But at least that way you don\u2019t lose the Assault Guard turn.</p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/details/Abenius/#adventurer-pull-plans","title":"Adventurer Pull Plans","text":"TheAxolotl's Pull Plan <p>I like Abenius' kit so I pulled three copies - one for the base, one for the OCD Discipline, and one to inherit to MC.</p> Lynd's Pull Plan <p>She's hot so I pulled immediately.

Reducing the dampening of damage means he's not as impacted when fighting enemies that are strong against Light damage. His main downside is that he innately only can deal Light damage. This can be offset by inheriting some single target spells that deal other elements of damage, however without the inheritance, he will only have an elemental advantage against enemies weak to light.</p> <p>Changing his class to Priest will give him a wider selection of spells, as well, making him a very well-rounded Adventurer for support or damage purposes.</p> <p>His inheritable unique skill gets an extra nod in that if it is inherited by another character, that character will receive the full bonus of the damage dampening. This has some nice quality of life potential to boost the damage dealt by the MC (or your favorite damage dealers) against unfavorable element type matchups when they weild elemental weapons. Note that this skill does not have any impact on Undead or Entity resistance to non-spell attacks.</p> <p>Compared to Yekaterina, his damage will generally be more consistent, and he will be able to cast more spells overall, however he will be missing out on the bonus damage to undead and multiple innate elemental type coverages. This can be overcome by inheriting other spells on him to give him additional elemental coverage. Early game, the extra longevity will be nice, but will become less relevant as MP pools get higher and MP potions become obtainable. Still, he's an excellent pull and you have many options for spending his duplicates.</p> <p>Millennial Lord Adam is our third mergeable adventurer and a surprisingly solid sidegrade to the standard Adam. Madam's Discipline is weaker and may present a mental hurdle for folks that have invested heavily into the Standard Discipline, however his gains conditionally offset that loss.</p> <p>In particular, Light Shaft's Radiance gives a nice conditional damage boost that has two primary components to it. The first is an Elise and Milana-style column boost of ~10% to himself and the paired Light adventurer. This skill is not like Rinne's where it's active for her all the time. Adam must be paired with a Light type adventurer for either of them to see the bonus. As of now, the biggest candidate for this pairing is Abenius. The second component of this buff kicks in when facing a Dark type enemy, and that's an additional ~15% damage boost that behaves similarly to the Formation skills.</p> <p>Unlike Holiday Flut, who was generally considered worse than standard Flut, this skill change makes Adam a solid conditional support for Abenius (and other future Light type adventurers), even more so when facing Dark type enemies. One big consideration, though, is that his damage buff does nothing to reduce damage received from Dark type enemies, so running Adam in situations where he could die quickly (such as late in the Fortress and Catacombs) would still be just as risky. The second big consideration is right now, there are very few situations where you'd really be able to take advantage of the additional ~15% damage due to there not being too many major Dark type fights. The biggest one at the moment is going to be Morgus.</p> <p>Personally, I actually think Madam is stronger than Adam since I put relatively little value on Discipline, however I still probably wouldn't have a spot for him in my party unless I was building something explicitly for a single fight.</p> Frobro's Analysis StandardMillennial Lord <p>Seriously, how is this guy evil-aligned again? Whatever, I\u2019ll try to make this one short, Shelirionach took his job!</p> <p>Adam is positioned as this sorta damage-focused Mage compared to others. As a light element mage, his spells tend to hit most things for neutral, but in the rare occasion that it is resisted, his Wisdom of Truth overrides it. Because his Knowledge of the Millennial Lord passive gives him a cost reduction in the narrow band of 3-10MP cost spells, he is allowed to use single-target and row-target damaging spells a little more carelessly than other mages even when the type matchups are out of his favor. With the stacked MP savings, he is also slightly more enabled to use his \u201cdelete all\u201d button, Secrets of Laforos which he has just \u2018cuz.</p> <p>To offset his fragility as a elf mage he has an RNG-based damage mitigation skill baked into his inherit skill. This means he can feel that much tankier than other mages when using a 2-hand staff instead of a 1-hander and shield. Adam also has a strong discipline focus of Magic Power and Action Speed. Hit harder and faster, no complaints.</p> <p>Now, do you know who else is damage spell spamming, RNG damage mitigating, Mag Power + ASPD focused demon from hell? It doesn\u2019t help that she uses Adam\u2019s Wisdom of truth better than he does. Adam could just cast other elemental spells when needed, but Shelirionach\u2019s Slumbering Darkness is always dark. In the end, there are worse things to be than the 2nd best at a particular role.</p> <p>I figured Legendary alts would be straight upgrades after Wandering Princess Lanavaille, but this is a sidegrade at best and a downgrade if you already have high discipline on Adam. This new discipline focus is worse; MP &amp; ASPD would have suited him better if they wanted to go for something that\u2019s good for both Priest &amp; Mage. The column buff is cool, but it really only has 3 good targets for it right now and light in particular feels like the worst elemental type to be.</p> <p>If you want to switch MC to light and pretend you and your husbando are righting wrongs, holding hands and spreading light throughout the world of Wizardy; this is the unit for you! Otherwise, a mage who isn\u2019t Shelirionach? SKIP!</p> Karkarov's Analysis Millennial Lord <p>\"So the new alt skin character is revealed and it is ... MADAM!  For some this may be bad news, but Adam as a character has always been underrated in my view.</p> <p>Only two things have changed (outside aesthetics) for Madam, the discipline is now MP and Resistance boosted, and the unique skill gives a column damage buff if both members of the column are Light Element.  Compare this to original Adam whose discipline is argueably the best a Mage can get Magic Power and Action Speed boosted, and a unique skill that reduces MP cost on spells that are 3-10 MP.</p> <p>As a result, it is clear that Madam on paper is not a straight upgrade to Adam unlike Wana and Lana.  The discipline is simply worse than normal Adam, but Madam has a superior unique skill with damage buff potential, even more so when fighting Dark Element enemies.  It is situational however and relies on your party comp using a strong front line Light character such as Abenius.  If you do have the party make up to support it, there is more long term value there than the normal Adam's MP reduction skill.  Also who knows what characters will be introduced long term and how this will impact future value.</p> <p>Ultimately I think Madam is a better character than Adam, and I would rate him from a \"\"just the character\"\" evaluation as the second best Mage in the game at this time (6/19/25).  He is still not up to par with our Sleepy Queen Sheli, but he is closer than other Mages.  Madam is a character that will show their true value months after their release, it will depend on what Drecom releases and if more strong Light front liners are imminent.\"                                    </p> Shiro's Analysis StandardMillennial Lord <p>Starting with inheritance we got one of best possible picks in the game that I absolutely recommend to have on everyone you use on at least lvl 1. Not only it removes dampening of damage but it gives you (rng based) reduction of damage and bonus MP. The removal of dampening is game changing for any elemental skills/weapons/mages which lets you go against enemies that usually would resist you without DMG drop. On top of that damage reduction while rng based gives you better long run survivability especially if you have other sources of damage reducing passives/skills. At the same time it\u2019s Adam's weak point because his inheritance is so good that it\u2019s generally better to invest it in your team over investing in him.</p> <p>Moving on his passive it's a great economy helper that shines mostly in first and second abyss. Sadly for whatever reason it\u2019s capped on 10 cost abilities thus reducing its impact on third abyss. Unless the values won\u2019t change it basically means that from the third abyss onward his passive is basically non existent.</p> <p>Moving to discipline while it\u2019s great to have magic power and SPD the difference between it and base disc stat growth is minimal so it\u2019s nothing to write poems about. It\u2019s nice but that\u2019s all.</p> <p>His class change is priest which is the best available class change for mages. It gives access to MP based cleanse and supportive skillset. And if you don\u2019t have good gear for mages but you have some good light armor gear pieces it allows you for more flexibility when you stay in this class. Absolutely one of best class synergies in the game.</p> <p>To sum it up Adam is an amazing mage and I\u2019d say he\u2019s among five best mages we have in the game right now (2025). If you do like him then he\u2019s definitely worth investing and using. But if you want to go for the best pick it might be better to use him as inheritance and go with other mages like Alice, Miliana or Sheli. In the end it's a matter of personal preference. But Adam is never a wrong choice or bad pull.</p> <p>Madam is a great alternative to Adam. That\u2019s if you use his passive. Basically if you use Debra, Clarissa or Abenius as damage dealer you can push their DMG really hard against dark enemies just by having him behind them which is a really solid option and upgrade over his normal passive in later parts of the game. But that\u2019s only if you have a light adventurer to support.</p> <p>As for his discipline it\u2019s downgraded for mage class while it\u2019s upgraded towards his priest class. You can\u2019t go wrong with more MP and having a bit more resistance even if highly unlikely might make a difference one day.</p> <p>To sum up Adam's alternative costume is much less of a solo/ego character and seems to lean to be a good priest option, and honestly? It\u2019s one of the best ones if you can make use of it. Definitely a must pull for Adam fans but in the end it matters how well you can fill him in the team and whenever you have or not other options that fit you better.</p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/details/Adam/#adventurer-pull-plans","title":"Adventurer Pull Plans","text":"TheAxolotl's Pull Plan <p>While I like the changes to Adam's kit here, he's likely a pass for me just because I'd be hard-pressed to fit him in my party most of the time.

Time will tell for sure, but enough about that - let's talk about her kit!</p> <p>First, let's touch on her passive skill, Priest Overseeing Life and Death. This works similarly to how Iarumas works, increasing Attack and Defense while in the front row, and Div and MDef while in the back row. It also allows Divine Power to contribute to Attack Power when equipping a 1h mace. I personally haven't tested this out yet, but in theory, this would allow you to build a front line priest with a heavy Div focus and have 1h mace do better-than-garbage damage. That being said, this component of the passive doesn't mesh quite as well with the rest of her kit.</p> <p>Her inheritable active spell, LITOKAN, deals moderate row-range fire damage based on Divine Power, not Magic Power. It also inflicts a fire resistance down debuff, which could get annoying to deal with when it comes to the 3 debuff limit, especially since there really aren't many, if any, folks running around with fire-heavy teams. I'm not entirely sure how the damage works on this one, but in general, Moderate damage is generally fairly respectable for a caster, however spell scaling in general is not that great.</p> <p>She also has a second signature, non-inheritable spell, and this is where her kit really starts to interest me. MAPORFIC is a row-level buff that shares a slot with Knight's Defense, which means it does not conflict with the 3 buff limit. Early testing points to this buff reducing damage dealt to the row by approximately 15% and lasts innately for 8 turns. This means if you have her first two turns be to cast MAPORFIC on both rows, Ainikki can provide a party-wide 15% damage reduction for the entire duration of most battles. The downside to this? Well, MAPORFIC costs 40 mp to cast. Luckily, this is reduced by Way of the Priest, which...she does not get by default. A single inherit, though, will take the cost from 40 mp down to 36 mp, which is quite noteworthy.</p> <p>The other thing I really like about her kit is that she gets access to MAKALKI. If you've ever talked to me in Discord, you'll know how much I love this spell. As of now, this makes her the only adventurer that can provide row-wide ailment immunity while simultaneously providing row-wide damage reduction to both rows (remember, both MAKALKI and KD are class-specific abilities). She also gets Recovery, which is definitely one of the better Knight passives out there. Alt Alice is able to do similar with MAKALKI + her signature passive, but that is locked to the row she is in.</p> <p>The other thing I'll touch on with her kit is her offensive abilities. She gets access to Guardian Blow and Fortified Strike, which are relatively underused and expensive skills, however they enable a unique way to build Ainikki. By focusing her blessings on ASPD, Divine Power, Surety, and MDef/Def, she can be in a unique spot where she could use SP to contribute offensively and MP to contribute defensively to a fight, while picking up gear that up until now would largely be tossed out as useless. To top this off, she's able to wear Heavy Armor, which already has a lot of base Defense to fuel those Guardian Blows and Fort Strikes. This is in no way a meta build, but it's definitely a unique one, and it's something I'm excited to play around with.</p> <p>Also, she does get access to 2h swords, but that really doesn't mesh well with the rest of her kit.</p> <p>All in all, I actually really like what I'm seeing here. If Ainikki really is the teaser to Lord the way Iarumas was the teaser to Samurai, her kit makes me very excited for what Lord will bring, and I actually like her kit as it is - the combination of MAPORFIC and MAKALKI alone is exciting to me. That being said, many folks will struggle to find a place for her on their team, especially if they're already running Alice and/or a Knight.</p> Karkarov's Analysis <p>Well other than Garbage Ainikki seems to be the character everyone wanted the most for the new Blade and Bastard Collab, so how is she?  Is she the \"actually a Lord class 2 hand sword DPS god who also does everything a priest can\" people were predicting?  No.  Not at all.  So what is she really?  Well lets get into it.</p> <p>First off like all other collab characters she has a unique class, in this case it is \"Silver-Haired Nun\" and there is your first big clue.  Ainikki is mostly just a Priest.  Gear wise she has some interesting additions.  Namely she can in fact use one and two handed swords, can use heavy shields, and can use heavy armor.  Beyond that she has the standard Priest Class gear options.  So this means she can be tankier than other priests (not that normal priests aren't already tanky) and has more options if you really want to use her as front row DPS.... but you absolutely should not do that.  Why?</p> <p>So As the gear suggests Ainikki has dipped her tows outside Priest in her unique class, but which class did she dip into?  Well it wasn't Fighter or Samurai, it was Knight.  This creates a big problem for her on the front row, she can hang there and surive for sure (honestly any correctly set up Priest can) but like Priests despite the razzle dazzle she does not bring any meaningful DPS which means you are losing a better DPS option such as Fighter, Samurai, dagger Ranger, or even a plain old front row Knight to run her there.  Like Priest she is really meant to be in the back row as a support.  This is made evident by her unique skills and what exactly she brought from Knight...</p> <p>From Knight she gets ... Stun Bash, this is not a DPS skill it is meant to be used on enemies weak to Stun.  Self Healing, again more of a sort of tanky self support sustain skill.  Fortified Strike.... a bad DPS move based only on your defense stat.  Lastly from active skills it is Guardian Blow, the best Knight DPS move yes but it's damage is based on defense and magic defense and requires you to equip a heavy shield to use it.  The only Knight passive she learns is also Recovery which only helps you get over status effects.  So yeah, there went your two hand sword DPS queen dreams Ainikki gooners.  Her own unique passive \"Priest Overseeing Life and Death\" does give her divine power added to attack power... but only when using one handed maces.  Which if you ever look at her character art or any of the Manga pages that aren't memes Ainikki's go to was always a spiked one hand mace.  This makes sense and fits the character, but also means if you want to use her as front line DPS she will be totally reliant on very robust skill inheriting as she has no DPS passives (in fact only 3 passives total and the other one just boosts Div Power on ambush) and no actual DPS attack skills that aren't based on defense stats.</p> <p>But what about her discipline surely it is god tier!  Not really, she gets attack power, which for reasons already outlined above has no synergy with her base skill set, and divine power.  It isn't god awful but action speed or especially MP would have been a lot better than attack power for her.  So this is a big shrug of a discipline that doesn't really do anything impressive or help any weakness she may have.</p> <p>What about the priest side.... well here is where things look up.  If you look at Ainikki's skills it is obvious she is a support caster.  Her unique non inheritable skill is actually one of, if not the, best defensive spell in the game.  It is Maporific an 8 turn damage taken down buff for 1 party line that reduces damage taken by 15%.  It does have some problems... first it does not stack with Knights Defense.  It is a one or the other situation, longer duration but lower damage reduction or barely any duration but crazy high damage reduction.  So situationally KD will be better, but in general Maporific is the better choice.  What's the other drawback?  It costs 40 freaking MP.  That's right, 80 MP to put it on your whole team for one fight.  Meanwhile Ainikki is MP'd like a Priest, not a MAge, so even at 70 this is a huge percentage of her casting reserves.</p> <p>Her other unique spell which is inheritable is Litokan, a line aoe fire element spell that claims it does moderate damage based on divine power and may reduce enemy resistance to fire damage by 10% based on divine power for chance proc.  In reality this should read does dog water damage where you will probably need level 2 or 3 at level 70 to do damage on par with a level 1 mage Mahalito.  (ok it isn't that bad really, but this spell has no DPS to it, it does not do much damage).  This is pretty much only useful as a \"I am running a fire team using fire element weapons and attacks lets hope to get lucky and debuff the enemies to buff my teams damage\" spell.  So it is basically a pure team comp gimmick skill.  So I can't say this skill is really all that \"hot\".  cwutIdidthar dad jokes and puns lol</p> <p>Ainikki has also lost a few Priest spells like Badios for example but who cares?  The key skills are all there.  Makalki, Abit, Dios/Madios, etc etc.  What is not there, just as mention before, is passives.  She only has 3 passives not counting her discipline, and they are not great ones.  To be a good support caster for real she will still need inherits, just not as bad as it would be for a DPS role where she has to start from all but scratch.  At minimum she REALLY needs way of the priest and some passives to boost her MP desperately.</p> <p>In closing she is a good alignment elf lady of fire element.  That about sums up the issue, fire element isn't good for casters, elf lady is better for mage than priest, good alignment doesn't play well with Alice buff and you do want Ainikki on the back row.  There just isn't much synergy on this character.</p> Shiro's Analysis <p>So\u2026 we finally got Ainikki who a lot of people wanted to get into the game. My first impressions of her were in lines \u201cwhy doesn\u2019t she have a fighter kit with a priest, she's a backlane unit so why good?\u201d. But that was pretty much me being stupid and not understanding the kit at all. Also I had high hyped expectations because I like the character\u2026 But moving on to actual review.</p> <p>First of all she\u2019s a priest. That\u2019s what you need to set in your mind. And she's a frontline priest, using her in the backrow means you\u2019re wasting her potential because you either are used to \u201ccaster backrow only\u201d and the idea of having a caster in front doesn't sit there.  I get it, but she\u2019s more like Gerulf or Abenius case where she wants to sit in the front row and take damage, keep your team alive and do damage\u2026 and honestly? She\u2019s really good at all of those.</p> <p>Starting from gear choice, unlike normal priests she has access to heavy armor and once you hit copper ranks you\u2019ll want her to run with heavy shields at very least for Guardian Blow. But hey does that require a lot of def to actually work? Not really if you have silver gear. Basically from what I\u2019m seeing and testing so far Ainikki can focus purely on divinity and aspd like a normal priest while filling usually dead slots with surety and accuracy. If you have access to heavy silver armors getting defensive blessings isn\u2019t that needed.</p> <p>Basically what I\u2019m trying to say is that her having access to the most important priest skills along with Guardian Blow or Stun Bash as options synergizes well with her kit. And it doesn\u2019t get in the way of how you would build her but instead it fills her kit well, making Ainikki a really solid priest who can definitely be around one of the better picks. (No, she\u2019s not rivaling Alice.)</p> <p>Going for her inheritance it\u2019s AoE fire damage skill, but like everyone is aware spells have terrible scaling for now and spells are pretty much the worst option for damage even for AoE losing massively to Rinne\u2019s inheritance, Henrico secret inheritance or even Samurai Odacchi options. The second issue is fire res down goes against the limit of 3 debuffs so unless you need fire res down which from my testing is around only 10% you probably won\u2019t use this skill realistically unless in specific cases. At least it outdamages MAHALITO as an option but sadly it also costs more.</p> <p>Now to go to the interesting part. Her personal skill is 8 turn 15% DMG decrease. It shares a slot with knight defense so you\u2019ll be able to use only one but the thing is\u2026 8 turns are much more stable than every turn spam ability. And even with big MP cost knight defense is also heavy SP costly while being needed to be recasted every turn not once per battle. And honestly from what I\u2019ve tested? That 15% is enough to survive pretty much any fight where you need this extra bit of survival. But my recommendation is to give her Way of the Priest to cut the cost to 36 so you\u2019re using only 36 or 72 mana for whole fight stable coverage. For me? Sounds like a great deal.</p> <p>Her discipline is also great! It offers HP, SP and MP all the resources she needs as frontline priest. It would be perfect if ATK would be replaced with SUR but it\u2019s what it\u2019s. It\u2019s still an amazing option for discipline and while it could be a bit better it definitely could be a lot worse.</p> <p>But there are also weird decisions in her kit which I don\u2019t get. Good start is her passive which offers ATK on front and % of your DIV to ATK on mace\u2026 That just doesn\u2019t work. Mace are terrible damage options and even if that would be 100% DIV transfer the fact alone it\u2019s a 1H mace negates any possible damage from it. But let\u2019s ignore mace and assume you actually use a useful weapon for damage. You have ATK up on front and more ATK from discipline. Will you do dmg with fighter inheritances and build? Sure. But it\u2019ll be much lower. Even if you inherit DTS or Astral for damage purposes the damage will be just low and not worth the effort. So my point is\u2026 why? That design choice makes no sense for now but opens a gate for future rework of damage formulas I guess? As for now just go along with heavy silver gear and Guardian Blow and do actually good damage.</p> <p>So to finally close the case. Ainikki is in my opinion one of best priests in the game and I will definitely use her in my team, so far she helps me to trivialize content even more and negate any leftover RNG I had in fights. While she doesn\u2019t offer as good a supportive side as Marianne or Sheli as priests she definitely does more for my team than those two ever could. Because like one person told me let\u2019s be honest, if you\u2019re later in the game you\u2019re using mages only for BATILGREF and in my opinion for Malefic Wind\u2026 but realistically people with lvl 2 Dissipation don\u2019t care about it. Lack of porto or some knight specific tools like covers surely don\u2019t make Ainikki as strong as I\u2019d want her to be but I can as well not care that much because she's a really strong option for the team. Other passives like Way of the Priest or Knight can be inherited so that\u2019s not an issue. So ending up what I mean is, sure she lacks PORTO and stuff like Behind Cover, Cover Defense or All-Around Cover, but thanks to all the tools she already has I don\u2019t feel like she needs those. I dislike her having fire element over light element but at least she's an elf which is the best case for priests, and thanks to her being designed as frontliner she works well with Lana\u2019s buff.</p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/details/Ainikki/#adventurer-pull-plans","title":"Adventurer Pull Plans","text":"TheAxolotl's Pull Plan <p>I'm going to probably pull a few copies of her - I want to experiment with the MAKALKI + MAPORFIC combination.</p> Karkarov's Pull Plan <p>I ended up with 2 copies because she is actually in all versions of the B&amp;B Collab bones, but to be real, I was only pulling to get an Alt Berkanan Costume.  My advice is hard pass on this character unless you are a huge B&amp;B fan or just goon for Ainikki.  If her inherit were Maporific and not Litokan that story might be different, but it isn't.  Gandolfo with fighter / priest Alt class can do anything you would ever want to do with Ainikki other than cast Maporific and he is just one example.  He just doesn't cost gems or real world money and is a whole lot easier to discipline.

Thank you devs for teasing everyone with your silhouettes. There are quite a few unknowns around his damage scaling, but in general, I personally think Aldric is the first legendary thief that actually looks like they're great at doing what thieves are supposed to do, which is opening chests.</p> <p>His damage skill, Blunt Combo Strike, is very unique, but it is also what we're currently least clear on. First, what we do know:</p> <ul> <li>Regardless of weapon type used (Dagger, Sword, Bow), both the initial minor attack and the crow attacked are treated as a spear. This has some significant implications for its use, both positive and negative.</li> <li>Undead Slayer is the only weapon-based damage boost that works with the crow. This means other slayer properties as well as elemental type properties do not work with the crow portion, but they do work with the initial minor attack.</li> <li>The initial minor attack can trigger procs like Corrosion Dagger, Mace of Tumult, and Staff of Weakness, but the crow attack cannot.</li> <li>The initial minor attack is not forced to a single hit and instead uses the number of hits provided by the weapon, plus an additional hit for the crow. For example, using a 2-hit weapon, his skill hits a total of 3 times and using a 3-hit weapon, his skill hits a total of 4 times</li> <li>Despite the <code>Details</code> page of this skill indicating that there are efficacy increases with higher skill levels, since this is his non-inheritable skill, it is currently locked at level 1, so we can't actually increase its skill level.</li> </ul> <p>The evade and counter component of this skill is also pretty negligible. While it is boosted by an Alice inherit, it's only actually going to provide damage if he evades something, which means he needs to be attacked by an attack that can be evaded and countered. If this does actually happen, it'll be crow damage, which is nice. Unfortunately, it's not going to be too reliable.</p> <p>As far as what we don't know, we really have no idea how the damage of either component scale at higher attack power levels. Since the initial attack on his skill is credited as a <code>Minor</code> attack, my suspicion is it'll see its power soft cap at around 300-350 attack power. The crow component on the other hand is different and I suspect behaves more like Sheli's sleepy nuke. More testing needs to be done here, though. I'll update this section as we learn more.</p> <p>Moving on to his inheritable skill, Wisdom of the Crafty Old Dwarf is tailored towards being a thief, which is great. That being said, the actual increases are pretty small. On him at skill level 1, it increases his Detect and Evade Trap each by 2 and his Disarm Trap by 5. These are reduced to 1, 1, and 3 respectively when inherited to someone else. The table above will gradually get filled out as we see what the inherited value increases are. The downside of this skill is that it's a pretty low value - on him, it's roughly equivalent to a single Bakesh inherit and a bit over 2 Jean inherits. One someone else, it's roughly equivalent to 1/2 Bakesh and 1 Jean inherit.</p> <p>His Discipline skill, Adept's Rule of Thumb, is going to be very similar to his inherit in that it'll be improving his disarming abilities at a minor rate. Detect and Disarm Trap are definitely two of the stats that get better value out of Discipline, but it's still going to be a relatively low value per dupe in general.</p> <p>The biggest hurdles that Aldric needs to overcome are the fact that he's a thief and the fact that there's already a lot of competition for both rows within a party. Many veteran players stopped using thieves quite a long time ago and have instead made MC or a ninja their disarmer. As such, his value is going to be relatively low for parties with established disarmers. Given the uncertainty at this point around his damage longevity, it's hard to immediately recommend him as a long-term member in a party since thief damage drops off pretty significantly in the later content. That being said, if you want to run a thief, he's going to be the best thief in the game right now at doing a thief's job of disarming traps. If you use a ninja like Rinne as your disarmer instead, inheriting him to her definitely couldn't hurt, but he's also a fairly easy skip.</p> Frobro's Analysis <p>Well, well, well; he\u2019s a thief alright. If opening chests is what you need, this guy has the capacity to be the best in the game at it. Both a chest opening-based discipline focus and inherit; all function, no flash. It's not a particularly tempting offer given the alternative of \u201cgit gud\u201d costs $0, but maybe future chests will be difficult for non-chest specialized thieves to open? Is this what the streets wanted; A chest opening legendary?</p> <p>Now that unique is something; it\u2019s kinda like Sheli\u2019s if you squint. It's a decently strong attack that kinda costs 0sp to use, but has a prerequisite attached to it and you can\u2019t cast it directly\u2026mostly. I am of course referring to the Bird-counter part of the attack specifically. After the turn you use the skill, you need to be targeted by an attack that can be evaded &amp; counter-attacked and you must evade the attack. A few things need to go your way to get more than 1 bird hit, but it is possible and you are guaranteed 1 on the turn you use the skill, so it can seem like an equivalent to Sheli\u2019s at a glance. Defense penetration can be incredibly strong. The Bird\u2019s damage is not subject to the range penalty, even if you don\u2019t have a bow equipped and its damage doesn\u2019t seem tied to ATK power. While I am unsure how it scales with DEX exactly but, at the current lvl cap, it is pretty strong but heavily reliant on getting surety. </p> <p>Beyond that, as a standalone skill\u2026yikes. It\u2019s Black Beast Feint that replaces the row aggro ailment with a minor attack + 1 bird hit for 5 more SP. You\u2019d have to use high-leveled Attract Hit or Defensive Provoke separately to expect to get max value from this skill. So now you need to inherit an Alice to extend the buffs for maximum effect. Also, this skill cannot be leveled up with codexes. Compared to Slumbering Darkness\u2019s easy prerequisite, direct MAG power scaling and negative MP cost, it really feels like the devs dropped some hot \u201cmid\u201d again.</p> <p>Despite the rant, Aldric is probably the best thief in the game at max potential, but not so much so that many veteran players are replacing their invested thief over.</p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/details/Aldric/#adventurer-pull-plans","title":"Adventurer Pull Plans","text":"TheAxolotl's Pull Plan <p>I'm likely going to skip him.

Not only is she our first Legendary priest, but both of her skills are fantastic. Increasing her buff/debuff turn count by 1 means she gets an extra turn to heal, deal damage, or apply another buff/debuff before needing to reapply the initial. Furthermore, her damage increase to a row can apply to many af our strongest damage dealers.</p> <p>Changing her class to Mage will give her a wider selection of spells, as well, making her a very well-rounded Adventurer for support or damage purposes.</p> <p>To make things even better, many other characters will benefit from Alice duplicates. Inheriting her skill on your other favorite buffers/debuffers will allow them to each provide an extra turn for their buffs/debuffs!</p> <p>The turn duration increase from her Blessing of Agora skill adds one to the counter at rank three (on Alice, rank 5 on non-Alice), so it's possible to get at least a 5-turn duration on buffs and debuffs, which adds to the strength increasing her skill through inheritence.</p> <p>If you pull Alice, she will be a fantastic addition to your team!</p> <p>With her new style, Alice continues to be one of the best adventurers in the game. Without drilling into everything about her kit, I'll just touch on some key things to note. First, she trades her damage boost for damage reduction, which could be a situationally better option!</p> <p>If you're a fan of Discipline, then her MP + Div is a pretty solid option.</p> <p>She also has a really neat (in theory) SP/MP restore skill. This is great, but there's a bit of an elephant in the room here. The trigger rate is abysmally low. Based on testing with sample sizes of 1000+ casts, we're looking at a ~6.5% trigger rate on Alice herself for skill level 1. When inherited to someone else, this drops to around 4.5% or so. This is so low that it falls in the territory of triggering when you don't need it and not triggering when you do. Tests of a significantly smaller sample size show skill level 7 on Alice herself at around 16%, which would put skill level 6 inherited to someone else at 10% or less. Be aware of that before you get a ton of copies to inherit around and hope to see an impact. You'll see it trigger, but likely not often enough to make it overly impactful, and possibly just often enough to be infuriated by when it triggers.</p> Frobro's Analysis StandardSnow-Sleeved Maiden <p>Simple but effective. It didn\u2019t take much to be the best in slot at what she does. Optimized stat line from Water/Elf/Female and has the ideal double caster class set. The best buffer/debuffer in the game; being able to reach a turn cap that other characters cannot. A rock-solid unit when used and desirable inherit when not. </p> <p>A passive 10% damage increase with an easily met condition for the whole row. Has access to an, as of now unreleased spell with her Secrets of Labadios just \u2018cuz. An alright discipline focus with Divine Power and Magic Def; not good, not bad. The MP gains from leveling up Blessing of Agora feels like she has 3rd discipline anyway.</p> <p>You can change her into a mage (after learning all priest spells first) and sacrifice some HP/armor and gain some MP and the entire suite of mage spells, with practically no loss of healing potency.</p> <p>There isn\u2019t much to say; this chick excels in the roles that units like her were designed to play and has some staying power with her inherit should the game ever shift to being more buff/debuff-centric.</p> <p>Year 2 of the game, and some things never change; Alice is still the best in slot priest. Depending on how you look at it, this Alt is either a buff to your core Alice (unlocking \u201cD18\u201d / Switching IVs / Adding MP refund passive) or a slight upgrade if you don\u2019t mind the costume.</p> <p>MP + Div is a better discipline than what core Alice has going on, and once you reach discipline lvl 1 with both styles (when merged), you can use core Alice copies to level up this discipline. At a certain point in progression, you\u2019re strong enough to blow through enemies, and the 10% damage increase passive is just overkill. A damage reduction passive is better than a damage increase that you don\u2019t need. Because of the stage at which it activates in the damage calculation formula, it results in a greater damage reduction than I think the devs intended (I assume they aimed for 10%), which is neat.</p> <p>Speaking of \u201cneat,\u201d the MP/SP refund skill seems pretty good til you find out how low the proc rate is. Don\u2019t ever expect to see this make a big impact. Seriously, a passive that was just a 2nd stack of the \u201cWay of the Priest\u201d effect would result in more effective MP than this skill does at max lvl.</p> Shiro's Analysis StandardSnow-Sleeved Maiden <p>Starting with her inheritance we have access to basically \u201ccheat\u201d and arguably best inheritance in the game. Having bonus one or two turn duration on any character or even up to four Alice is absurdly game changing for any buff/debuff rotation allowing things like lasting warrior battlecry enough for two FPS rotations. It\u2019s even more impactful on priests and mages, giving them bonus free turns for any sort of healing, more consistent rotations, usage of items or additional damage. Some people seriously downplay how strong is passive that basically breaks one of game rules. Great to have lvl 1 on everyone and maxed out on Alice. You\u2019ll be playing two different games depending if you have it or not.</p> <p>Moving to her passive. It\u2019s lane DMG buff which is nice but I\u2019m personally not really impressed by those whenever it\u2019s Alice or Lana. It\u2019s nice to min max damage and it might help but the impact isn\u2019t that strong unless you stack multiple of them (like Milana or Madam on top of it) so in the end it\u2019s still a solid option especially if you run Alice as mage.</p> <p>Moving to her discipline while it\u2019s somewhat nice to have I wouldn\u2019t even consider investing in it especially when her inheritance is so powerful. Might be a different case if we get her alternative style in future but I can\u2019t imagine what kind of disc it would need to have to even compete with another option to use her additional copies. </p> <p>Her class change is mage. Which is absolutely the best option available with access to more MP based spells, offensive abilities or debuffs. Especially impactful on Alice with access up to four bonus turns on everything she cast. On top of that she has the perfect setup to be a mage leaving poor Adam behind and being able to compete with Sheli having edge over the supportive part while falling in pure damage to her. </p> <p>To sum it up Alice is an absurdly strong option for both priest and mage. And honestly? Our arguably best caster that is sometimes downplayed. She\u2019s not only breaking game rules making some short duration buffs really strong but she\u2019s also a great magic damage dealer thanks to being female-water-elf mage. While this game doesn\u2019t have any \u201cmust have\u201d characters Alice will definitely make your game way easier when you\u2019ll invest into her. As for now we don\u2019t have any better supportive option so go ahead and worship Agora and enjoy the easier mode of the game with the strongest caster next to Sheli.</p> <p>Seems like devs don\u2019t hide who their favorite child is. Remember how Yekaterina's summer version passive had little impact because of not only physical DMG reduction (which is extremely rare against backrow) on herself with the extra condition that she needs to be in the back row? Welcome to Alice, with all DMG reduction without row conditions, for the whole row not just herself and\u2026 with some absurd values. I don\u2019t want to throw out the exact numbers because of not understanding the whole formula\u2026 but it seems that in the end it's way more than 10%...</p> <p>Either way her discipline is better than base one (MP+DIV), her new inheritance is\u2026 questionable. And very much easy to skip. That\u2019s one of those rare cases where a disc brings more value than inheritance. Going to her passive which is usually either overkill or just a nice way to throw up your Yuzu and whichever evil dps in backrow on base version\u2026 the alternative brings damage reduction which is overall more useful. Unless you\u2019re one of those leviathans going for Alice + Milana combo to oneshot GWO with Yuzu. So basically it\u2019s way better passive for most of us regular folks who don\u2019t swipe. Especially if you have some low HP mages in the backrow who die once in a year from random GWO attack. Of course she keeps her \u201cbalanced\u201d bonus turns on passive which still makes her BiS priest. Especially now when she hits such absurd lvls of MP that with her random triggers she\u2019s arguably better healing bot than Marianne for auto (just use Sheli for it really).</p> Karkarov's Analysis Snow-Sleeved Maiden <p>So up front warning, I am not going to discuss standard Alice... at all.  There are already plenty of reviews of her out there on this site but also on tons of others.  So what is this about?  The new Alice Alt Skin, Shrine Mainden Fru Fru Alice of course.</p> <p>So first up, the Alice Simp armada is going to be upset because she of course loses her normal form inherit.  This time she gets \"Grace of the Dark One\" which gives a chance upon using a mp or sp skill to regenerate up to 40 mp or sp.  PROBLEM STATEMENT: this sounds cool, except it has been tested by our loveable crew of whales in the Faster Thoughts Wiki Backrooms already.  The proc rate just isn't any good, even on Alice, at level 7 (the max) it is only activating around 15% of the time.  That means even with incredibly high level of investment this is still only going to proc a regen 1-2 times out of 10 uses.  It doesn't suck, but it isn't reliable enough to be something you really \"count on\".  So it is a so so skill, is what it is.  For those curious max inherit on a non Alice (level 6) is around 10ish percent give or take.</p> <p>Next up we have her Discipline...  Well this is actually good news if you ask me.  Her new Discipline Skill \"Spiritual Power of the Dark One\" increases MP and Divine Power.  This is versus OG Alice who is Divine Power and Magic Defense.  So slight improvement here.</p> <p>Last but not least her unique uninheritable skill also changes, no more row damage buff, instead... it's \"Heretical Blessing\" and reduced damage taken to everyone in the row, as long as no one in row is good alignment per usual.  It may just be be, but I honestly kind of prefer this over the normal version, often times you are putty squishier characters in the back, or if you are using a Knight they well could be back there.  That extra damage reduction may be a big deal in those cases.  I \"think\" it is still a match to previous Alice skill... as in 10% reduction, but I need to do more testing.  I will update this analysis if it turns out different.  This one is sadly a little trickier to test than damage skills etc.</p> <p>In the end though she is an Alt Skin... which means she can be merged with normal Alice, and merging is always good.  As it gives free trait points, and allows for extra sources to stack discipline.  Also unlike normal Alice, it is a no brainer on this one.  The inherit skill just does not have a good enough proc rate to really be worth it, it's a luxury item so to speak, not something you \"need\".  So it feels a lot easier to use Fru Fru Shrine Alice for discipline unlike Normie Alice.</p> <p>Also... I honestly think the character design for this alt skin just runs rings around normal Alice and is just a really nice look for her, so there is that.</p> <p>All said, I don't think throwing some pulls at her is a bad idea, especially if you are an Alice stan, and there a lot of those.  I do think the new formation skill has a little more versatility than the old one as well, simply because you generally want your big guns on the front row not the back, A4 is definitely a place where running casters more often is not a bad idea, and it plays well with the back row Knight gimmicks.</p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/details/Alice/#adventurer-pull-plans","title":"Adventurer Pull Plans","text":"TheAxolotl's Pull Plan Snow-Sleeved Maiden <p>I snagged a copy for the merge.

It hits hard and provides a solid damage option for thieves. It's very costly SP-wise, at 20 SP for level 1, and being an elf, he already has a smaller SP pool than Debra, who is going to be his most common competitor. This skill is effectively an attack that simultaneously casts <code>PORTO</code> on himself and the adventurer in front of or behind him.

For more extended fights, there's definitely value in it, but it's possible you could mess up your own turn order by getting <code>PORTO</code> simultaneously on one of the fastest adventurers in your party as well as presumably a slower one. Second, the fact that this buffs in a column means you have to pay extra close attention to your formation, as you'll want to position Arboris in front of someone that could gain value from the <code>PORTO</code> buff and have it actually impact the flow of a fight. Third, the <code>PORTO</code> portion is a buff, which makes it subject to the three buff limit, so if you use him, you'll want to keep that in mind.</p> <p><code>Lord of the Deep Forest's Leadership</code> at a glance seems like solid evil and neutral support, however it also has some issues. First and foremost is that for the two skills being buffed, it is very hard to evaluate the effectiveness of the buffs. It is a Synergy that behaves similar to Rinne's Surety boost, always applying to him and extending to others that meet the criteria. Since it is a Synergy, that means we are unable to see the exact amount being modified, so it's a bit of a guess to know if it's even providing value. Initial testing currently seems to point to it being bugged and not doing anything, but we can't say for sure at this time. I'll update again when we know more. Assuming it is working, there are a few main scenarios I can think of where the action speed boost from <code>Lord of the Deep Forest's</code> may or may not be relevant.</p> <ul> <li>You are perfectly speed-tuned to go ahead of most enemies you face and your buffers/debuffers always go before your damage dealers<ul> <li>In this scenario, gaining some passive action speed won't do much for you since it won't change your turn order and it won't make you outspeed enemies more than you're already outspeeding them</li> </ul> </li> <li>You have not spent much if any effort on speed tuning your party but you have made it so your party always goes before most enemies<ul> <li>In this scenario, the action speed could be nice, but you probably won't notice much of an impact since you aren't too worried about your party's turn order in general</li> </ul> </li> <li>You have speed tuned your party to go in the order you want but some of your party is still being outsped by enemies<ul> <li>In this scenario, you might see some benefit, as the action speed gains could be enough to finish getting your party going before the enemy, however it'll be variable based on the enemies you face. For example, vampires seem to have somewhere around 115 speed, and this synergy is very unlikely to be able to help you reach that.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>One potential consideration is that you could cut down on some of your ASPD blessings on certain adventurers because you know that they'd be getting the action speed from <code>Lord of the Deep Forest's</code> however that isn't something I'd really advise since we don't know the magnitude of the buff.</p> <p>I'm generally not a big fan of Discipline skills to begin with, so this will be short - in general, <code>King's Disposition</code> is absolute garbage as far as Discipline goes.</p> <p>Overall, having a conditional passive speed adjustment for a row and having access to a two-person <code>PORTO</code> could be situationally useful, but for most players, if you want to really mess with speed turning during a battle, using <code>BATILGREF</code> and <code>PORTO</code> will likely be both sufficient and a bit more consistent.</p> Frobro's Analysis <p>I feel like people see something that I just don\u2019t with this one. Let\u2019s start with the good. Astral break is a Major tier damage skill that doesn\u2019t require setup like Sneak Attack, and since thieves are unimpressive in fights, this seems like a way to alleviate that. The cost of 20SP is way too high and the ASPD buff is generally unimpactful and cumbersome when trying to maintain more relevant buffs against the 3 buff limit. As an inherit to others, they\u2019re better off using other damaging skills. It being earth element is lame too.</p> <p>Evil wins again with his passive Evasion and ASPD buff. I thought Wizardy \u201cevil\u201d was supposed to mean more self-centered! On the flipside, this discipline focus is a joke! Accuracy and Stun Tolerance\u2026what?</p> <p>In closing, he\u2019s a thief alright. A skill he can only use a handful of times, anti-synergy between his race/class, one of the worst disciplines in the game and limited availability. There are better general adventurers than this. Mid.</p> Karkarov's Analysis <p>How to sum up this character.... I think I know.  If I took the Drake Sword from Dark Souls 1 and turned it into a Wizardry Variants Daphne character it's name would be \"\"Arboris\"\".</p> <p>This character looks great at low level and in early game content thanks to his ridiculously expensive Astral Break skill that has a great damage floor, but garbage damage ceiling.  His earth element makes him seem top tier in the water paradise of abyss two.  Then you get to the lots of earth enemies abyss three, the SP cost of Astral Break combined with Thief drop off in damage potential makes you realize he isn't that good at doing damage over a long dungeon trip, the increase in enemy surety resistance, accuracy, spell use, blah blah blah.  Then you realize his value is falling so fast it might as well be a rock tossed off a cliff.</p> <p>Just like the Drake Sword he is a newb trap.  Something that is really strong in early game, but long term stops scaling and getting better, and gets surpassed by just about anything if you know what you are doing and how to invest in a character.  </p> <p>To make matters worse he has a terrible discipline (accuracy and stun tolerance boosted), his formation passive rules out good characters and is a very minor stat buff anyway (some I know have tested and suggested it is single digit numbers maybe even as little as 4 or 5 aspd/evasion), and he just got his alt class and it is Priest.</p> <p>Priest does basically nothing to enhance Thief beyond Priest Weapon Mastery which is +20% of your Piety to attack power.  Too bad Elves have low Piety, and Thief is competing for lowest Piety growth in the game.  Expect like 5-6 whole more Attack Power for this epic skill.  Even better all Thief does for Priest is a slight buff to Action Speed and Evasion.  There is just no synergy between these two classes, and with this second class Arboris is doomed to the role of just a support character.  </p> <p>Good luck outsupporting Mage/Priest Alice, Adam, or Yekatarina, or tanking Diva's Savia and El Dorado.  How about Madam with a Light Element character in front, or Mage Milana with Gerulf, or Elise with anyone nuetral, or..... you get it.</p> Shiro's Analysis <p>Starting with his inheritance. While extremely costly it\u2019s one of the best late game options for any fighter/knight/thief. The reason behind is not only really high dmg and def bypass but build in column porto on cast. Having it on all the three rows with a mage that can cast BATILGREF can completely change how a fight will go, making some impossible fights into doable ones. The issue is that skill is extremely weak early game on. Well\u2026 not exactly weak. It\u2019s very costly. So you probably will never use it outside the boss in the first abyss similar to the second abyss. On top of that Arboris SP poll is quite lacking. While earth element and thief class prove a bit of SP it\u2019s still nowhere close to beastfolk. Things change as soon as you hit the third abyss or you\u2019ll have access to Debra\u2019s inheritance/SP relics. With it Astral Break becomes your best stable DPT option as long as you can maintain SP cost, turning a lot of fights (especially harder ones like any sort of superboss or 0C GWO with def up) into much easier ones. But that\u2019s also his curse. Why use Arboris\u2026 if you can just inherit his astral to fighters with 2h weapons?</p> <p>Moving to his passive it\u2019s really good buff for neutral and evil allies. At least on paper. Because while it can buff aspd and eva for up to 3 of characters it\u2019ll rarely show value. Unless you\u2019ll make some extreme speed tuning to balance around it. But then\u2026 gear is RNG based. In the end it might help with hitting some speed break points but it\u2019s highly unlikely.</p> <p>Moving to his discipline. I don\u2019t even know what to write there. It\u2019s one of most useless ones at this moment unless for whatever reason the Necrocore focuses your Arboris all the time and you decide you need STUN immunity because of that. Otherwise I see no value in it.</p> <p>His class change is priest which isn\u2019t a surprise. His astral and passive skills were already selling him a support and devs only went further on it. Which in the end led to not as good as fighters damage dealer, but better supportive ability in battle. Which is still good. Having access to extra cleanse/buff in the middle of a fight in case things go wrong will never be a bad choice unless your brain focuses on \u201cunga bunga\u201d and you want everyone to just hit as hard as possible.</p> <p>To sum it up Arbois is a great option in abyss 2 and gets even better in abyss 3 and later as the game proceeds and we have better SP pools. He\u2019s a thief who leans to a supportive role in your team being 3rd slot fill next to other backliners you use (for example Alice and Adam). Him being a thief and having high ASPD while priest buffs being extremely cheap also allows you to throw out one of the priests that would just buff you otherwise and focus on one more damage dealer in a team. Definitely a really solid pick especially if you run neutral/evil teams.</p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/details/Arboris/#adventurer-pull-plans","title":"Adventurer Pull Plans","text":"TheAxolotl's Pull Plan <p>Arboris was a pass for me.

She is also a hybrid between a Fighter and a Mage, and compared to Iarumas, she actually has a better all around passive set. Having both Way of the Warrior and Way of the Mage means she has both a solid scaling damage multiplier, as well as a solid MP passive MP reduction for some of her spells. While Iarumas primarily focuses on being a versatile damage dealer, Berkanan's ideal role is, in my opinion, as a weaker fighter with debuff versatility.</p> <p>Coin of Power allows her to equip one-handed and two-handed swords, which pretty much cements her as a front line adventurer. In addition, it increases physical-oriented stats.</p> <p>True Words of Fire is a very unique spell. At a glance, it's HALITO that can apply two debuffs. Both of these debuffs will stack with other sources of the same debuff, but you'll want to keep in mind the debuff limit. This spell is going to take two of the three spots. One big unknown at this time is how exactly the level-based damage of this spell works. It will presumably hit harder than HALITO, but it's too soon to say how much harder, and will be something to keep an eye on. The formula for it appears to consider both Magic Power and Class Level when calculating its damage, but it's unclear if that class level component will continue to grow as levels increase past 60, or if that portion is based on a percentage of the current maximum level. One important thing to note is that True Words of Fire, like TZALIK, has an increased sure hit rate, but we also do not know if that is intentional.</p> <p>Comparing her to Iarumas, I personally think her kit is a bit more cohesive and specialized. Iarumas has a better single target nuke, but Berkanan won't suffer from the same longevity issues and the fact that she gets access to Immortal Strike gives her a self-healing ability that deals damage, which is something mages lack. Unfortunately, Way of the Warrior will not boost Berkanan's True Words of Fire spell (or any spells for that matter) - it only applies to her physical damage, and she's lacking access to Full Power Strike. As such, she'll need to rely on Wild Strike and Heavy Attack as her main sources of physical damage.</p> <p>An important thing to note is that while Berkanan has an arguably simpler to use kit and easier to understand role than Iarumas, she does not get any skills or spells outside of True Words of Fire until level 20. This means that she's beginner-friendly in her simplicity, but she is not beginner friendly to use for brand new players, as they will be left with just basic attacks and True Words until after the first Grade Exam.</p> <p>Like Iarumas, gearing her might be a bit funky as she might want Magic Power if you want to keep True Words of Fire as a potential damage source (assuming it considers class level and Magic Power, not just the former), but she'll also want Attack Power for other skills and basic attacks in her physical kit. Unlike Iarumas, there's no question of how to fit her in on your team. Stick her in front and give her a sword.</p> Frobro's Analysis <p>At present, I\u2019m not a fan of these phys/mag hybrid units. In practice, they are middling fighters who lack Full Power Strike, have gear restrictions and effectively learn their mage spell tree without needing to class change. I think it\u2019s pretty telling that the unit that\u2019d be the best at this kind of setup, MC, doesn\u2019t get built like this because there are better ways to build him. I do not expect this unit to ever get a 2nd class.</p> <p>Onto the specifics. Coin of Power solidifies her as a front liner, which is for the best since she is incompatible with all the evil back liners who want to spread their alignment buffs. Her discipline skill is proof that there is no justice in this world. Drecom knows what it takes to make a good focus and chooses not to for many units. True Words of Fire is Halito but cooler; gets much stronger when cast at higher levels.

She can deal strong damage for a thief, particularly later on when you have both Hiding and Sneak Attack unlocked. Her skills also allow her to regularly use Precision Strike to kill enemies for a net 0 SP use. When fighting bosses, her debuffs can be very helpful, with an extra nod to Delay Attack.</p> <p>That being said, it's very likely that other thieves might be released in the future that end up providing more damage or utility than she does. Her SP restoration becomes less crucial as she gets higher up in levels, as well, due to the high SP pool that Thieves have. She's extremely helpful to have now, but it's hard to say if she'll remain strong in the future.</p> <p>If you inherit her skill to other Adventurers, the restore amount will be cut in half, with skill level 1 returning 2 SP instead of 4.</p> <p>Debra's second style is here and boy is she okay. Setting aside the appearance factor, which is going to make every degen playing this game pull for her, the Golden Maiden style is a very minor upgrade in damage dealing potential to an adventurer that is rarely used for damage dealing.</p> <p>Golden Maiden Debra is focused on having very high surety, which is great until it isn't. Most of the hardest fights, where you'd want to see sure hits, have extremely high sure evasion values, which makes Debra's gains less impactful. In addition, her emphasis is on the 1h + Shield combination which is a weird mix given the recent 2h changes that push 2h (including bows) into the upper echelons of damage dealing potential.</p> <p>Looking at her skills, Dance of the Bold Advance gives her an unknown boost to Surety, Sure Damage, and Evasion while in battle. I suspect it's relatively minor, similar to all other passives like this, but hard to say for sure. It's certainly not a bad passive.</p> <p>Her new active, Mirage Hunting, is similarly okay. Early testing indicates that when it lands a sure hit, it's comparable in damage to Heavy Attack at the same skill level, but when it's not a sure hit, Heavy Attack deals more. This effectively makes it useless as an inherit to others due to the ~35-40% drop in effectiveness of active skills, which inherited Heavy Attack does not have.</p> <p>Her Discipline, Dancer of Liberation, boosts Surety, so it's already a non-garbage Discipline, and since it also boosts evasion, it's solidly synergistic with Mirage Hunting, effectively giving the skill a second minor surety boost. As with all other Discipline skills, though, it's a very low value per dupe, so keep that in mind.</p> <p>If you use Debra, her Golden Maiden form is a damage upgrade over her standard form, as long as you're using daggers or swords. The bigger question is whether or not she's worth a valuable first row slot in your party, and that's much more up in the air. She certainly won't compete with other heavy damage dealers such as Fighters and Samurai. We're also very close to the anniversary, so this banner is pretty much a big bait banner that many folks will be pulling on.</p> Frobro's Analysis StandardGolden Maiden <p>Talk about suffering from success. An inherit so desirable that people prefer to give it to other units rather than build it up on the unit who gets the most potency out of it. Debra is a more damage-oriented thief than her peers not unlike how Adam is with mages. Her Skull Study reduces, the cost of \u201cthief spells/skills that cost 3-10 MP/SP\u201d and when coupled with Blessing of the Beastfolk God, she can use Precision Strike as a replacement for her basic attack extremely early in the game. At those early sections of the game, that +30 surety from Precision Strike is outrageous. </p> <p>As a side note, Precision Strike is in the daily shop rotation, which makes it a surprisingly easy skill to level up for being a premium skill with no inheritor. Another idea is to inherit heavy attack instead as she can still more freely use it with her high SP pool and SP regen. While on the subject, her high dexterity makes her a good candidate for inheriting high levels of Armor Break which will also synergize with Cunning Pursuit for even more damage. Who cares about the discipline, when you can level up the inherit on anyone?</p> <p>Plus she\u2019s neutral aligned which lets her be compatible in the front row with Lana as a dodge tank with her high evasion, or as a bow user in the back with Alice. She is held back by her 2nd class being knight. I wonder what the people would think about her if it were fighter instead\u2026</p> <p>Aka, Debra 2. As a stand-alone unit, she\u2019s on par with the other premium thieves like Aldric, Arboris, Rinne, and Savia, which is basically normal thief utility with some extra spice on top. The \u201cspice\u201d normally comes in the form of an attack that can shore up the thief class\u2019s weaker damage output relative to fighter/samurai. In that regard, Golden Maiden is no different. Mirage Hunting is the attack that\u2019s better than Precision Strike 3 that Debra needed, though you may need to level the skill to 3 before you can really feel it. But what\u2019s not to like; it grants bonus surety rate/damage that scales of evasion! With enough surety and this skill, you can reliably get sure hits on enemies that the devs didn\u2019t intend us to!</p> <p>The Discipline is better than base Debra\u2019s being Surety &amp; Evasion focused, but I can\u2019t help but feel like the unique passive is worse. Ever since the 2-hand weapon rework, 1-handers that aren\u2019t exceptional are in the mud. You\u2019d be better served by giving her a bow, even if you are in placing her in the front row, which means he passive won\u2019t ever be activated. While not super strong, base Debra\u2019s thief skill cost reduction passive is better than nothing.</p> <p>The most interesting thing about this new Debra is that she gets full potency on both of her inherits at the same time! Full SP regen + Full strength Mirage Hunting, no matter what style she is currently in! Plus, if your merged Debra is D1 in both styles, you can use Base Debra to discipline the Golden Debra Discipline since they share levels. If you get 1, merge it with base Debra.</p> Karkarov's Analysis StandardGolden Maiden <p>I really like giving the melee / physical dps I use Debra inherits.  Debra herself?  Her alignment lets her work in a lot of dispatches, so that's cool.  No seriously, she is too valuable as an inherit, and there are too many other thieves and knights in the game that are competitive with her or better.  Arboris, Bakesh, Amelia, Viviana, hell even Jean, or if he ever gets a re-run the my opinion best thief in the game Aldric.  Knight wise there is Balbadus, Savia, El Dorado, Ekhart, or you know.... alt class Elise????</p> <p>Her discipline is mediocre (+attack, and + paralysis resistance), her non inheritable skill is just bad (-sp cost on 3-10 sp thief skills), she is fine as a thief party member if you are new and happen to pull her I suppose. However, long term, there are just better choices, and her inherit is too valuable on other characters.  Her class combo of thief / knight is also not doing her any favors.  Go with thief / fighter \"IM PHILIP!!!!\" over Debra even, and no I can't believe I actually typed that.</p> <p>Well this is new, the alt skin is so much a different character you don't even recruit her with the name Debra.  Well I clearly wasn't impressed with Debra herself over than as an inherit fodder for other melee/physical attackers.  How will the Gold Maiden fair?  Spoiler: not much better.</p> <p>So Mirage Hunting reads really cool and on paper looks great, but in actual practice it is simply very very bad.  On a level vs level basis it will just edge out and beat Heavy Attack, but it will also cost much more SP than Heavy Attack of the same level.  If you perform a Heavy Attack level attack that is still close to the same SP cost of your Mirage Hunting level but just slightly less SP how does it go?  Well.... Heavy attack just does slightly more damage for slightly less sp.  Yes, even if you don't inherit it and use Mirage on Gold Maiden herself.  How does it perform on inherit?  Yeah, don't do that, it is absolutely garbage.  As an inherit it loses to preceision strike, nuff said.  This sounds great on paper as I said, but in real use it is just bad heavy attack.  All the gimmicks of evasion contributing to surety damage etc simply dont add enough on the low base damage to make a meaningful difference.</p> <p>What about the new uninheritable unique skill?  Well it requires Gold Maiden be in the front row.... that's bad unless she is a knight really but ok.  Oh and you have to use a one hand weapon and a shield.... so the sub optimal dps choice for a knight.  Sweet.  Simply put this skill is what I am calling a \"Gerard Tier\" skill.  Doing what you need to do to activate it results in a worse set up than just ignoring it does.  If you really use this character it either needs to be back row thief with bow, or front row knight with a two hander to help on dps.  Both of those choices nullify this skill.  Normal Debra's uninheritable skill is bad, but at least it does \"something\".</p> <p>There is one single glimmer of home though if I am being honest.  She legitimately has a good discipline, Surety and Evasion boosted.  This is a straight improvement over normal Debra, and helps her hit the surety she will need a lot easier at higher discipline levels.  So yeah, this is actually a nice uplift for the character if you can burn resources to build the discipline.</p> <p>Also despite the bedazzling, new name, and new skills all around.... she is still thief / knight.  This is just not a great class combo and there is no way around it.  Is she better than standard Debra?  Yes, Gold Maiden is absolutely better than normal Debra. Is she better than a leveled fighter / thief Benjamin with discipline?  No, not really.  Even though this is an improvement on the character, and she is going by a new name, she is still just Debra at the end of the day.</p> Shiro's Analysis StandardGolden Maiden <p>Starting with her inheritance she gives you the ability for a better SP economy. Which\u2026 similar to Adam is more a problem for her than a bonus. Because inheriting her physical characters make it easier for you, leading to less interest in raising Debra herself. Still, her inheritance is amazing and it\u2019s definitely shining in earlier parts of the game and in castle ruins.</p> <p>Moving to her passive. Again similar to Adam it\u2019s limited up to 10 cost abilities. Why? I wish to know. So similar to Adam it\u2019ll show value in the first and second abyss and fall in the third one. </p> <p>Going to her discipline allows you to build paralysis tolerance\u2026 which is niche at best for now. Unless we won\u2019t get more annoying enemies with it in future it\u2019s not really worth consideration as for now.</p> <p>Her class change is knight which is IMO upgrade over her thief class. Not only her SP regen is more impactful there thanks to lower SP pool on knights but she\u2019s also having access to better weapons and more armor pieces making her easier to build. On top of that she\u2019ll have less survivability issues letting her to be picked against some dark bosses with light weapons and Madam for optimizing her damage potential.</p> <p>To sum it up\u2026 it\u2019s really short analysis but there\u2019s just not much to talk about. Her main selling point is her inheritance and ability to make abyss one and two easier for people in early game, with Old Castle on top of it\u2026 but that\u2019s pretty much all. She's a standard banner and she\u2019s great at doing what standard banners characters should do - making game easier for newbies.</p> <p>As soon as she dropped I was amazed reading how much text her passive and inheritance had. Which turned out to be effective bait\u2026</p> <p>Starting with inheritance. It\u2019s not worth using it on other characters. It works good on Debra especially if you hit lvl 3+ on it and you have somewhat descend evasion (200+ with bow). From my personal experience using Mirage Hunting works better when she uses it as a knight and would be really great if she had access to fighters to balance out STR and evasion even more\u2026 but it\u2019s what it\u2019s</p> <p>Moving on her passive. It barely helps from what I\u2019ve noticed. A lot of text with minimal effects. As a thief you\u2019re better to go bow on frontline with her than shield+sword/dagger, and as a knight you have even better 2h weapon access. I don\u2019t need to say much more there. And no, even when I tested it with +60 evasion shield with a really good Sword of Promise it doesn't even come close to covering the difference with sword vs bow (at least on lvl 1 Mirage).</p> <p>Her discipline is actually amazing and it\u2019s one of those rare cases where it\u2019s worth investing. Mostly thanks to how strong SUR disciplines are compared to rest. </p> <p>To sum it up. If you like using Debra and you want to use her go ahead and pull. Get her Mirage Hunting on at least lvl 3 and then you can think about raising her discipline on higher levels. Or just focus on getting lvl 7 Mirage Hunting while using regular Debra for upgrading her discipline. Anyway she's a solid option for a thief and she\u2019s on the better end of them. Just turned out to be more impressive by sole descriptions rather than in practice. She\u2019s also performing better as a knight than a thief\u2026 so go ahead and grab her book if you\u2019re using her. Thanks to the latest auto battle changes she\u2019s our auto queen now allowing all the skills up to 13 SP to be cast for free (as long as you have her inheritance maxed out).</p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/details/Debra/#adventurer-pull-plans","title":"Adventurer Pull Plans","text":"TheAxolotl's Pull Plan <p>I might snag a copy just for the merge, but in general, I'd rather save for the anniversary.

Welcome, Erwin!</p> <p>Looking at his skills, Flames of Gluttony is...weird, both conceptually and mechanically. Conceptually, we have a single target spell that gets stronger the more enemies you're facing. What's problematic about this is generally when you're facing multiple enemies, you're not going to want to be using single target spells - you'll want to either use MA/LA spells or use crowd control such as KATINO or KANTIOS. From early testing, the damage boost per enemy does not seem to be a linear percentage increase. The variability of damage in general makes it hard to determine, but first glance looks something like a smaller damage increase per enemy when facing 1-3 enemies, then larger increase per enemy at 4+ enemies. Since this is from inherited testing, you can assume an additional ~33% or so more damage if you're using him directly, which is...fine.</p> <p>Unlike TZALIK and True Words of Fire, this spell does not seem to have a lowered Surety threshold, which is unfortunate but expected.</p> <p>His passive, Spellcraft Bookmark, is roughly a non-compounding 2 MP reduction starting on turn 2 of using the same spell in a row, regardless of the spell. It's damage increase is also a non-compounding 10% or so.</p> <p>His Discipline is what you'd expect for a mage - Magic Power and MP. Nothing massive, but all around fine.</p> <p>So what does this amount to? An overall lackluster legendary that gives us great incentive to save for the new class near the end of the year. Of all the great things they could have done with a new legendary mage, this is confusing and not really one of them.</p> Frobro's Analysis <p>I held off writing this one just to see if something was coming in Abyss 4 that Erwin was going to be really good for that we just couldn\u2019t see at the time. Nope; he\u2019s just not good! Mostly because Mage as a class is pretty bad; or rather, magic damage is worthless.</p> <p>Neutral Elf with MP + Mag pwr discipline, not bad. The passive that increases damage and reduces the cost of repeat spells is a start, but it is nowhere near enough! The damage softcaps for spells are atrociously low. Even casting higher levels of damaging spells hardly justifies the increased mp cost, and even with this discount, Erwin cannot afford to spend his resources for pathetic damage every battle.</p> <p>Then there is Flame of Gluttony\u2026There isn\u2019t a single fight in the game that this spell is good for. The damage is low even under the best conditions to say nothing of the fact that aoe damage/debuffs is the only thing mages are good for in battle and you need to ignore that to even have a reason to click this. This guy seriously has no redeeming qualities. Unironically weaker than Halloween Asha, a fire mage, with a 2nd class (priest) that came out weeks before him. What more can be said?</p> Karkarov's Analysis <p>Drecom has delivered on their promise, the Trap Master is here and their name is Erwin!  But trust me, they aren't a Trap Master because it is a dude that looks like a girl.</p> <p>So lets start by discussing what is good about this character.  Well they are an elf mage, so that's pretty solid for trait synergy on like IQ and Speed.  They have Neutral alignment so will work well with a wide variety of formation buffs and unlike that other fire mage that is a woman they don't conflict with the Alice buff.  Also their discipline is ok, bigger boosts to magic attack and MP are solid for a mage and could have been considerably worse.</p> <p>Well that does it for the good.  Glad we got that out of the way.</p> <p>Their unique non inheritable skill is \"Spellcraft Bookmark\".  This skill, if you cast the same attack spell back to back, (note attack spell, not buff, not heal, not debuff), you will do 10% more damage and the spell will cost -2 mp.  On paper this may apply to SP attack skills as well based on the way the skill is written but I will be honest, he is a mage, he will hit like a wet noodle and has very little SP so this is not worth testing.  What if you somehow cast the same attack spell three times?  Well .... it does 10% more damage and costs 2 less mp.  That's right, this skill doesn't stack, it doesn't get better the longer you keep this one skill chain going, it is just 10% and -2 mp. </p> <p>Meanwhile I drop Alice in my back row and as long as no one is Good alignment suddenly all of them have always on +10% damage, not just one of them, and certainly not only if they cast the same attack spell twice in a row.  And who is that over there?  Adam?  Oh yeah doesn't he reduce MP cost for any spell that is 3-10 mp... like basically all level 1 attack spells, even leveled debuffs etc?  Whose that on the broom over there .... Sheli with actual MP Regen?!?!?!</p> <p>I think you get it, this skill is a combo of things other casters do.  Which while it's nice to combo, the way it's designed means it isn't always \"on\", and the other casters all do the uni task action better than Erwin does.  In other words, this skill is mid at absolute best and cannot be relied on to make any real difference in a fight or help staying power over a long dungeon run.  I would rather have the unitask ability of any of the casters mentioned above, and considering two of them are from the general pool that is not a good thing for this banner.</p> <p>How about his inherit skill, lets let little Conan Bro shine here!  Imagine, you are facing down a large group of enemies, like 8 guys.  This is it, the one scenario where mages are still king!  Their aoe's while lower damage hit all targets making a big impact that with even just two mages can mean a whole common mob army is toast!  I look at \"Flame of Gluttony\"  AHAHAHAHA YES! Mage Supremacy BABY, it does increasingly more damage the more enemies there are!  Prepare to see this whole group die in burning ash akin to the flames of hell it.... wait what.... what's that say, it's .... single target.</p> <p>...</p> <p>That's right.  Leave it to Drecom to make a spell that gains power the more enemies there are, give it to the class whose only real damage role is aoe'ing large groups, and then make it single target.  With low enemy count this spell is basically just Halito 3 at level 1, and if that excites you well I guess it isn't a terrible personality trait to be easily impressed.  At least you will go through your day a little more uplifted.</p> <p>For me though this spell is literally landing like a wet fart that smells of cabbage and failed dreams.  If you bump it to like level 3, the enemy is wind element, and you got like 6 enemies at least it will probably do really respectable damage to be honest.  But you still probably would have killed the whole group if you had just cast Lahalito 1 or 2 instead as opposed to just one of them for a spell that costs as much MP.</p> <p>Like this is not the worst legendary attack skill I have ever seen, but it is not anywhere near what I would call good.  It is effectively just slightly better Halito.  A good analogy would be going to Mc Donalds and ordering a double quarter pounder with cheese, except wait.... you have them add BACON!  It is still a DQ with cheese man, those two stringy as hell microwaved pieces of bacon don't really elevate it to anything special but your burger does cost more \"MP\" now.</p> <p>This character is just not good.  Any other legendary mage is better, as horrific as this is to say, if you REALLY want a fire mage, Alt Asha skin is probably better.  So yeah, this character is the Trap Master.  Because he is a pure bait banner meant to con you into wasting resources.</p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/details/Erwin/#adventurer-pull-plans","title":"Adventurer Pull Plans","text":"TheAxolotl's Pull Plan <p>This one is easy.

Let's jump in!</p> <p>First, Tyrant's Gravity is...probably a waste of a skill slot. The initial \"taunt\" (Attract-hit style) isn't bad, but it's limited by the fact that it only lasts 3 hits and is not guaranteed. Initial reports put it as \"better than Attract Hit\" but it's hard to measure how much. If you're fighting a single difficult enemy, this has the potential to last for 3 turns, but in other fights, it could be gone in half a turn, so keep that in mind. Not bad. Not great. Doesn't hurt anything. Hard to say if it'll really help much.</p> <p>Raging King is very interesting. This skills has a unique charge-up mechanic that actually changes the skill name per hit received in a turn from Raging Skill I through Raging Skill V and into Raging Skill Fury (6 total power levels) every time he gets attacked within a turn. The skill then resets itself on his next turn, whether or not he uses the skill. The key thing to note here is that in order to benefit from the charge up, he essentially needs to always be alternating turns with the enemies. If the turn order ever goes <code>enemies -&gt; Galb -&gt; Galb -&gt; enemies</code>, the second Galb will not have any chance to get boosted damage. You could have some very interesting skill combinations here, particularly if you inherit Wild Strike to him. A scenario where you have the turn order shift from <code>Galb -&gt; Enemies</code> to <code>Enemies -&gt; Galb</code>, could result in extra charging for his attack. With Wild Strike being used to slow himself down, you could end up in a <code>Galb -&gt; Enemies -&gt; Enemies -&gt; Galb</code> situation for additional chances to charge. Conversely, you really don't ever want to PORTO him unless you're okay with an additional turn of a no guaranteed charging.</p> <p>As far as damage goes, it's hard to measure the effectiveness of active skills, but initial testing shows an inherited Raging King I to be between Heavy Attack 2 and 3 - essentially inherited Raging King = Heavy Attack at the same SP level. When kept on him, it will be ~35-40% stronger, which is quite substantial.</p> <p>One other important thing to note is that Raging King is currently locked at melee (1 row ahead) range. It does not follow weapon range, so this largely rules Galb out as a back-row adventurer. Keep this range in mind if you are using him or inheriting his skill. We are not sure if this is intended behavior or not.</p> <p>The odd part about this is his base class of Knight, which makes you want to treat him as a defensive adventurer. Don't! That's not his role. Instead, treat him like a damage dealer as you would Shiou or Fighter Lana. On turn one, use any skill - it doesn't matter too much - it could be an inherited buff such as Warrior's Battle Cry (or even better, Lingering Blossom, if you have a spare Shiou) or it could be something from his own kit like Attract Hit or Knight's Defense. From turn 2 and on, just spam Raging King until things are dead or you have no more SP.</p> <p>A few additional things to keep in mind.</p> <ul> <li>Depending on the fight you're in, it's very possible that Raging King will stay at I or II the entire fight. Some fights might let it climb up to Fury level, but the fewer collective hits coming his way, the less charging up he's able to do.</li> <li>Similarly, if he's protected will, in a fight like Emergency Occurrence, you can expect to see his skill be charged up fairly high every turn, so expect high levels of damage when he's at risk of getting hit multiple times.</li> <li>Knights typically don't have the greatest SP pools. This is somewhat offset by the lower skill cost, but something to keep in mind.</li> </ul> <p>For those that like Discipline, Bestial Roar is pretty solid - what's not to like about Attack Power and HP?</p> <p>In general, Galbadus is a fairly future-proof adventurer. The charge-up mechanic of his active skill isn't likely to be powercrept by future skills, and most future class options will enhance his combat abilities. Since you'd want to treat him as a damage dealer, his place in your party would be comparable to that of a Fighter or Samurai. Comparing him to Fighter Lana, he gains more personal damage but loses out on the end of battle heal and the row-level ~8% damage boost. Comparing him to Shiou, he gains more survivability and isn't quite as high risk. His damage level for the average player likely falls somewhere between the two, and it rivals and can potentially surpass Shiou if he's using a Cuisinart with the equipment available at the time of his release. Also, he looks pretty bad-ass.</p> <p>When deciding to pull, the biggest question you want to ask yourself is if you have room in your party for him. If you're already running a party consisting of Fighter Lana and Shiou, you probably don't need him. If you've missed out on Shiou, he could be an excellent high single target damage substitute.</p> Frobro's Analysis <p>What a cool-looking guy for such a straightforward game plan. Seems like a remix of Savia in a way; both are reliant on being targeted by enemies to do some of the highest damage any knight can output, but otherwise, they don\u2019t stand out too much compared to other knights.</p> <p>His discipline focus of attack/HP is fine, but a solid step down from Savia\u2019s weird double evasion focus. Raging King is cool, and it\u2019s nice that he has a button to click that isn\u2019t one of the easily inherited Heavy Attack equivalents, but you can get higher damage with fewer strings attached elsewhere. Also for some reason, they forgot to give it the \u201cweaker when inherited\u201d clause that every other legendary inherit gets. Tyrant\u2019s gravity sounds strong until you remember that taunt skills are whack, and this is a taunt skill that can\u2019t even be leveled up.</p> <p>This guy is in the wrong class on top of having a suboptimal alignment for being a front-row unit. Playing casually, he looks pretty neat, Dark resist is key when facing the Abyss 3 superbosses and when the stars align and you land that Raging Fury 6; I bet he feels like \u201cthat guy\u201d, but outside of the vacuum, he\u2019s just\u2026suboptimal. Still strong though.</p> Karkarov's Analysis <p>So it is time to update this beast of an Analysis of some guys Gallbladder!  Galbadus, everyones favorite Dark Element Evil Beast Folk Knight not named Savia, has returned for a rerun, with a new alt class (Fighter), and right after the level cap has changed to 70!</p> <p>Sadly for Galbadus this is all bad news for him sort of.  Lets discuss why in this updated on 12/18/25 analysis.</p> <p>Fighter is the right alt class for him, but Fighter gained two new attack skills from 60-70 that are already more damage to sp efficient than his signature Raging King UNLESS he gets attacked multiple times before his turn.  And by multiple I mean like 3 or more times in one enemy turn.  Even then it will mostly be a close thing, if you level Raging King it can definitely bypass the damage of the new fighter skills at level 1, but will certainly be no where near as SP efficient.  Also Raging King got stealth nerfed and will no longer allow as many \"stacks\" of damage buff as it used to... whoops looks like Drecom noticed it was overtuned.</p> <p>All this means that Raging King is still a great skill on a Knight.... but on a Fighter who has learned the new 60-70 Fighter skills.... it is now ultra situational and probably no longer a good value proposition to level.  Unless of course your name is Moby Dick.</p> <p>Overall his biggest issue remains, he is evil alignment which means he breaks the Lana buff.  Now back row Fighter with a spear is better than ever, but as a Fighter/Knight Wombo Combo is he better than say Elise in the back row with the same class combo...  No, not really.  He doesn't suck, this class combo in the back row with a spear NEVER sucks.  He just isn't bringing anything that makes him clearly supperior to other characters with the same option that still work with the Alice buff.</p> <p>I won't lie, he is a strong character, his passive aggro draw on the first three hits is actually nice.  Raging King value has taken a very serious hit though, you kinda don't want him in the front row (yes Lana is that good) and he isn't really doing anything in the back row that others can't also do.  My original analysis was \"not blown away, won't put him in some must pull list, but I see why people like him, and situationally he is really strong\".  My analysis now is \"Not blown away, his design is still cool as hell and one of the best Drecom has ever done, but he isn't really situationally much stronger than any other Knight/Fighter anymore.\"</p> <p>So yeah TLDR, Galbadus sadly is one of the characters that has not benefited from the 60-70 change through no fault of his own. Raging King simply lost value full stop.  He doesn't bring much to the Fighter big picture, and only really benefits noticeably from Raging King if you keep him Knight.  But who keeps a Knight / Fighter combo on Knight in this game outside of gimmick fights?</p> Shiro's Analysis <p>Starting with his inheritance. Oh boy\u2026 it\u2019s one of the best ones in the game as for now. Especially if you run into harder fights where the enemy has multiple attacks per turn. As far as I tested his skill, it beasts damage options like FPS (for example Raging King can bring constant 4.5k DMG per turn on lvl 3 compared to FPS doing 8k only on much higher attack) or DTS as soon as you grab a few attacks in your direction. And this will also be his main selling point. It\u2019s strong enough to a point where it\u2019s worth inheriting it to other characters because even in the worst case scenario where the enemy doesn\u2019t attack it\u2019s as good as Heavy Attack at very least.</p> <p>Moving on his passive.. it\u2019s good for auto farming when you run Morgus buff to make it more stable and lessen rng in fight\u2026 or take less rng in some fights with bosses in first turns (especially good if you want to have specific focus on single target bosses like 0C GWO) but outside it\u2026 it\u2019s lacking. It\u2019s only 3 attacks long.</p> <p>Moving to his discipline we don\u2019t have anything special there. It\u2019s focused on HP+ATK. It\u2019s something but not much. Not worth the focus IMO (unless you rate 8 more ATK and 24 more HP on LVL 9 discipline that much).</p> <p>As for class change he doesn't have any as for now but I do hope he\u2019ll get a fighter.</p> <p>To sum it up\u2026 when Galba arrived and I saw his kit I was honestly disappointed\u2026 he had great design but his kit felt lacking\u2026 that was until I pulled and used him. His active skill is completely absurd with how cheap the dmg tradeoff is. On top of it I thought that he\u2019s bad because he's a knight not a fighter\u2026 but in practice it turned out that access to cover ability (especially passive like behind cover) allows him to stack his skill really easily making him the best knight with DPT potential next to Livana. Still\u2026 he needs a fighter for counter/follow up attack/Way of the Warrior/Immortal Strike/Wild Strike which will cover his kit even more. As for now I\u2019m unsure whether it\u2019s better to run him as a knight for easier stacking of his active skill or pray that he\u2019ll get a fighter and run him as one. Either way Galbadus turned to be not only an amazing visually designed character but an all over solid damage dealing knight. With only downgrade being that his skill is always melee locked. Great addon to your team and completely worth running an evil team with him over bothering yourself with Lana buff.</p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/details/Galbadus/#adventurer-pull-plans","title":"Adventurer Pull Plans","text":"TheAxolotl's Pull Plan <p>While his active skill seems fun and is potentially very powerful, I don't know that I'd necessarily have a place for him in my party, so I'm likely going to skip.</p> Karkarov's Pull Plan <p>I can't suggest you pull this character.</p> <p>Ironically my updated for Abyss 4 (12/18/25) pull plan still uses the same first line it did when Galbadus released.  Galbadus is a great Knight/Fighter for people who are hard core about theme teams like Beast Folk only or Evil only.  But outside that Gillion does 15% more damage than him all the time with no gimmick just 5% hp loss.  Lana gives her godly row buff and has an insanely better discipline.  Elise in the backrow buffs a nuetral and herself 10% damage plus is easier to D9.  Abenius gets that always there flutter dream, does not break the Lana buff, and if you use \"Madam/Chadam\" can get a strong damage synergy with him in the back.  Livana is still the muscle mommy, doesn't break Lana buff, and frankly especially in A4 with two hand changes.... Moonlit Axe Toss is a better skill than Raging King now.</p> <p>If you love his design and are one of those theme party people go for it, pull one copy.  As my analysis implied if your name is Moby Dick go for it, cause who cares in your case?  But seriously, if you are anyone else, seriously consider holding onto your gems a bit longer.

He's not a bad legendary by any means, but many of his initial advantages have been relegated to less impactful now that we have new adventurers and skills available to us. I wouldn't go as far as saying he's been powercrept, but he's definitely lost a bit of his luster in comparison to when he was initially released.</p> <p>His Thunderstrike skill is very potent when hitting weaknesses, and having the chance to paralyze your foes can be a nice added bonus. Unfortunately, with the addition of Full Power Strike to the Fighter arsenal, even if class changing Gerard to Fighter, his signature skill becomes a conditional attack at best. Full Power Strike will be both more efficient and overall higher consistent damage than Thunderstrike. Another key thing to note is that he is a Dark type adventurer with a Air type skill, which means he misses out on a same-type damage multiplier when hitting weaknesses, which is unfortunate.</p> <p>Lightning Celerity is fine - it's a passive personal evasion increase, however it's a static increase and not a percentage, so it will lose value as stats increase.</p> <p>Gerard's biggest disadvantage is that he is designed to do damage, but his signature skills don't contribute much in the way towards dealing most of his damage. He has a small niche in that as of his first rerun, he's still our highest damaging Knight adventurer, but his access to a Fighter class change largely renders his Thunderstrike skill obsolete in a large majority of current content.</p> Frobro's Analysis <p>This game\u2019s poster boy for \u201cMid. A good aligned, front-row knight with a Heavy Attack but green skill that doesn\u2019t even match his element. What is there to say? At least his 2nd class is fighter, so he isn\u2019t truly bottom tier. His passive and discipline aren\u2019t bad, but they\u2019re not impressive enough to salvage this guy.</p> <p>This guy\u2019s job is to be the resident low-value buzzkill, when pulling for some other legendary once limited legends get added to the pool. Outclassed by general adventurers, what a life.</p> Shiro's Analysis <p>Starting with inheritance\u2026 It was made for Helmut alone in mind for early game\u2026 but for whatever reason Gerard himself is dark. So it never was a good synergy or good damage option. One of the most niche at best inherits.</p> <p>Moving on passive. It\u2019s good, especially in the earlier part of the game. Having more EVA is not a bad choice and helps especially in the early part of the game. Sadly it falls off heavily later on.</p> <p>His discipline further pushed the idea of him being a dark evasion tank\u2026 which wasn't a bad idea I guess? But hey\u2026 Savia exists\u2026 So I\u2019m unsure how to feel about it.</p> <p>His class change is fighter which is his saving point. His passive and discipline come more at play there making him easier to build. Nothing amazing honestly but it\u2019s still a really solid option if you like his design.</p> <p>To sum it up. Gerard is a solid pick that\u2019s mostly mediocre when it comes to everything. His inheritance wants Reaven Dagger to proc more paralysis and synergy good with wind damage\u2026 but we don\u2019t have earth enemies to play on it too much. On top of that he's a dark element so he\u2019s out of synergy with his own skill\u2026 but it\u2019s something that saves him later on making him a solid fighter option for abyss 3 where dark damage is quite present\u2026 The issue is that he\u2019s not unique in it and Gandolfo or Elda fit the same role. While I do think that Gerard got way more hate from the playerbase than he should, he's still\u2026 just solid. Maybe in future when we\u2019ll get access to farmable 3 hit weapons his inheritance will shine with more common paralysis procs but as for now\u2026 there are other options.</p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/details/Gerard/#adventurer-pull-plans","title":"Adventurer Pull Plans","text":"TheAxolotl's Pull Plan <p>Gerard was a solid pass for me.

The issue being that you need a 2h hammer for it. For himself with a 2h hammer? It's a great damage skill that will ditch out really high DMG and it\u2019s nothing to laugh about anymore. Might synergize well with picks like Amelia/Chloe/Lana/Raffaello and shine strong if we\u2019ll get wind theme abyss.

But it could as well not be there and no one would see the difference.</p> <p>Moving to his discipline. He\u2019s got one among the best for pure unga bunga purposes. SUR focused discipline is always a good choice to rise especially if you\u2019ll want to max out and use your Gerulf. And it\u2019ll be his best possible choice unless his future alternative version won\u2019t bring something like double SUR focus or SP+SUR.</p> <p>His class change is priest.

When it comes to unga bunga, Gerulf is your best choice and he\u2019ll do it better than any other fighter. Definitely worth dropping the idea of going crazy over Lana passive and using him if you like him. The only issue is that he\u2019ll be sitting on your front row with a 2h hammer to bring most of his potential. So if you\u2019re using for example Galba that are already 2 front slots taken. His Eruption Strike is doing great damage now, his setup (fire, male, dwarf) is perfect for fighters that benefit greatly from STR and DEX with only demerit - low SPD. His discipline is great. He\u2019s simple but he does what he\u2019s supposed to do the best - using a hammer for crowd control.

Read on if you're interested in specifics, but for those that just want some advice on whether or not to pull without knowing the why, I recommend skipping.</p> <p>First off, we'll talk about the easy one - his passive, Cursed-Blood Resonance, provides accuracy, action speed, and approximately a 15% damage increase at the cost of a loss of 5% of his maximum HP. Note that if he's below 5% of his maximum, this passive can kill him.</p> <p>Now, his active skill is much more interesting. Cry of Ruin has a lot going on. First, it's a medium attack that is a Dark type physical attack, which makes it subject to damage reduction when fighting Undead. Second, this attack is locked in to close range, regardless of the range of the equipped weapon, and is a single hit, so you absolutely do not want to be using it with a 1h sword or dagger. Third, the self damage costs 25% of his maximum HP (35% when inherited to someone else) and is additive with Cursed-Blood Resonance. This means he takes recoil damage equal to 30% of his maximum HP when he uses this skill and can absolutely kill himself with it. This damage is applied after any end-of-attack or enemy kill heals, but prior to an end-of-battle heal, such as Lana's passive HP restore.</p> <p>On to the weird stuff - the splash damage of his attack is very unique because it is based off the actual enemy formation and positioning. We don't have any real insight into those mechanics, but in general, this splash damage takes the damage dealt to the primary target and deals 35%, plus or minus X, of that damage to adjacent enemies. This splash damage is considered \"true\" damage, as it is based solely on the initial damage dealt (including factors like Slayer/Type weapons, Surety, and other damage boosts). If there are any targets adjacent to those receiving splash damage, they get hit with 35% of the splash damage.</p> <p>As an example, suppose you deal 3000 damage to target A in this enemy formation, this illustration shows the magnitude of damage that targets B and C would receive:</p> <pre><code>A (3000) - B (1050) - C (368)\n</code></pre> <p>When fighting undead, this splash damage will appear to be reduced further in the text display, however the numeric value is still calculated at the 35% as expected.</p> <p>Earlier, I mentioned the \"plus or minus X.\" This is where things get really weird. Enemy positions and formations are somewhat variable, so while 35% is pretty constant for most enemy formations, you'll occasionally encounter formations where enemies are slightly closer together or slightly further apart. These variances actually impact the splash damage, so against some enemy formations, you might see splash damage closer to 45% or 55% of the original damage, while in others, you might see splash damage closer to 15% or 25% of the original damage. Annoying, right?</p> <p>His Discipline is fine - it's attack power and accuracy.</p> <p>So, what does all this mean? Well, this is our third damage dealing legendary recently that follows the high risk, high reward approach after Shiou and Galbadus, with the caveat that he's probably the highest risk for the lowest reward. If you plan to use his active skill, you effectively have to treat him as having 30% less effective HP, which can be very detrimental in some fights. While his attack is our first true physical row attack (Rinne's MoF targets the enemy's MDEF instead of DEF), the nature of the splash damage makes it not very well suited for acting as a row damage attack. If you're using it to farm, you'll constantly have to be restoring his HP between fights. If you're using it for progression, many of the encounters where you might want to deal large levels of row damage against difficult enemies (certain Emergency Occurrence strategies, for example), have enough enemies that lowering Gillion's effective HP is a bad idea.</p> <p>There are some unique positives to this skill, though. The first is that the splash damage being true damage could be helpful to chip away at any future encounters were we might have enemies that are largely immune to physical damage (depending completely on what those enemy formations might be). Similarly, there could be future encounters where there is shared damage across targets, and the splash damage would let you essentially double-dip by dealing regular and splash damage to the shared HP pool. The second is that if you inherit his skill to the MC, you give the MC a very easy way to force a flame if an encounter starts going poorly.</p> <p>These use cases are far and few between, though. I wouldn't go as far as saying Gillion is a bad adventure. He's essentially Wizardry's version of Dark Knight Cecil from Final Fantasy, and Cecil is awesome. I love the idea of the Dark Knight mechanics, but unfortunately, they don't lend themselves well to the mechanics in this game, and he's definitely a risky adventurer to use for very little unique gain.</p> Karkarov's Analysis <p>First off I have to hand it to Drecom, from a visual design perspective they have been hitting home runs effectively every new character since Galbadus, and Gillion is no exception.  If you are a dark fantasy fan, or love yourself some Dark Souls like I do, there is a lot to visually like about how this character is designed and created.  He even has cool specific graphical and audio flair that is new to the game, IE in combat he wears a full face helmet, but post combat in some animations you actually see him take the helmet off, and when he speaks with it on vs off his voice will sound normal or muffled based on if he is wearing it.  I personally really appreciate these design details and the work Drecom is doing here, they could be brain dead like every other Gacha and just making \"hot woman #5 with cat tail and ears, make the butt bigger this time\" but they are actally being creative instead.</p> <p>That said what about his mechanical performance?  Well.... I can tell the visual and mechanical designers are probably not the same person...  Typically when a new Inheritable Attack Skill (especially one as complex as this) is introduced I try to write some kind of analysis and detail of it's function.  In this case I am not going to go into those details as Axolotl has already covered it exteremely well in his analysis.  So if you want the critical mechanical explanation please read his analysis he did a wonderful job on it.  Instead I am going to focus on value or lack thereof, of \"Cry of Ruin\".</p> <p>Well first off lets be real, costing 25% of the users hp (or 35% on inherit) is downright criminal for the damage it does.  If the damage were like.... double it would be worth tossing around, but it is around HA3 damage at level 1.  It is also close range only, so you can't use it from the back row at all.  On the bright side leveling it doesn't increase the hp cost so if you are insane you can level it to improve the damage without eating more damage in return.  Just know that level for level single target it also does less damage than Moonlit Axe Toss of debuffing and I can use it from any row I want.  Meanwhile it has the same sp cost and again... 25% (or more) of your hp lost for using it.  Heavy Attack starts to pass it as well single target wise past level 3 for again similar SP cost (HA 5 costs the same as Cry Cry Cry 3 but does more \"target damage\").</p> <p>Now before you stop the presses and damn this skill to the levels of Gerard and Gerulf attack skills (aka totally irrelevant and never worth using) there are SOME situations where it may be valuable.  </p> <p>For example, if you have an average or low defence enemy standing beside a nigh invulnerable massive defense enemy.  Since the splash damage is calculated only on the target damage this will deal effective damage to Mr Invulnerable.  An example of this would be the Golem Duo Superboss fight.  It is also honestly pretty effective against GWO3 by targetting his much softer tentacles, especially when the t rex armed body is buffed.  There is also one niche use as an inherit, it's a way to controllably drop Shious HP into Ephemeral / Water Formation levels while still doing ok damage, but without also putting a giant aggro target on Shiou's face which many Samurai skills do.  Lastly and quite hilariously, it does have value as a \"lets just reset\" tool.  You can use it to forcibly kill a character (yes spike damage you take for using it can kill you), then you can just intentionally fail the rez minigame to kill the MC. Boom you got a quick flame rez or \"accept death\" in a fight/run you know you aren't winning.</p> <p>Now that we have covered his crappy Emo Crybaby skill, what about the rest?  Well frankly the rest kinda makes me mad the skill is so bad.  His discipline is good, it is Accuracy and Attack Power, could have been surety but how often do I type that?  As a character his Dark element isn't the most meta stats wise but it does give him a little Luck trait kicker and is very useful defensively in many of the games hardest fights (as of 10/31/25 when this was written).  His alignment is also Neutral which is a big deal because it gives him the most versatility from a fromation buff perspective and matters alot because of the next thing...</p> <p>What about his passive uninheritable skill?  Ok upfront yes, as a result of \"Cursed Blood Resonance\" if you give him a two handed weapon (any two hand weapon) he will take 5% HP loss on attack.  Yes any attack.  Heavy attack?  Check.  Regular attack? Check.  Casting Feru with a two handed staff?  Check.  Counter attack?  Absolutely.  Perform an attack and miss?  Of course you take 5%.  Follow Up Attack?!?!?? Thankfully no, but you did a normal attack to proc it already.  Also he wont take 5% when casting buffs, debuffs, healing spells, defending, using potions, etc... I checked.</p> <p>However... this is a BIG one... He gains Action Speed, Accuracy, and roughly +15% damage when using a two hander.  Combine this with his element and alignment... you are looking at a Fighter who in exchange for 5% HP loss can run the Alice and Elise formation buff at the same time while adding his own 10% kicker.  This means Gillion can get a higher two hand damage \"just standing there\" buff than any other character in the game. Meanwhile as bad as 5% seems... is Lana in your party with her passive heal leveled?  Unless the fight goes longer than 2 rounds or Gillion actually takes real damage from the enemies the Lana heal will cover the 5%.  Then he can also use the Arboris formation buff, Red Beards too, etc etc etc.  This guy simply fits in any team comp you can imagine that isn't \"good or evil only\" and works.</p> <p>So he is potentially the best dps auto unit in the game (just put Elise behind him with a spear and Lana as always in the front row), and in actuality has real potential for manual use as a very serious DPS unit.  In my optinion the 5% sucks, but not so much it makes the passive skill bad.  It is not bad, I think it's actually great.  That said, Gillion is definitely not a new player friendly character despite being a fighter, and his inheritable attack is too niche to be called \"good\", it's kinda bad for normal play.</p> <p>EDIT NOTE: Extensive testing has been done at this point by multiple people, I am one of them, it is confirmed that despite the early implication his passive was 10% it is actually +15% damage.  This has been the consistent finding across multiple tests by multiple people.</p> Shiro's Analysis <p>Starting with inheritance. It\u2019s goddamn amazing. Low cost, hits hard. The downgrade? HP loss. So basically running him requests you to run 1 priest in a team instead of 6 full physical. Is it worth that one slot? From what I\u2019ve experienced it definitely is. The damage to the main target is huge. Bigger than DTS from my experience. But I\u2019m not sure about the precise difference unless I\u2019ll inherit one to him. But the main point is AoE. It\u2019s great, but only for him only. Unlike Rinne which is a great inheritance option for others, this is\u2026 mostly beneficial only for him as it forces you for front only AoE, so you lose the flexibility for more damage. And you lose 35% instead of 25% HP when it\u2019s inheritance.</p> <p>Moving to his passive. It\u2019s kind of good with questionable demerit that sometimes might be really an issue. While his buff to DMG + stats are good from it. And losing 5% per attack is usually not an issue\u2026 he also loses it on counterattack. So if you by accident survive lethal damage thanks to knight passive to end on 1 HP and you\u2019ll counter\u2026 yeah\u2026 you get my point.</p> <p>Moving to his discipline. It\u2019s ATK+ACC. Nothing special so the main focus will be on upgrading his skill. Especially since self DMG is % so getting more HP from inheritances/disc lvls doesn\u2019t help that much.</p> <p>To sum it up. Gillian is great and terrible depending on the scenario. If you run him with Lana/have Lana inheritance on MC you can ignore his passive demerit. If you run him with a priest you don\u2019t need to worry at all. His dmg is solid enough to help on bosses with multiple enemies. But\u2026 if you run him solo without sustain then he\u2019s performing as quite a mediocre unit. And unlike Shiou and Galba who were \u201cfake\u201d risk - reward units (one had just bonus skill on low HP that could be ignored, and another could just evade to hit hard) then this time Gillian is actual risk-reward character. His HP loss appears every time for great damage tradeoff. Is he must-pull or game changing character? Definitely not. Is he good? Yes. But he\u2019s heavily team dependent so take it in mind when you\u2019ll want to use him.</p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/details/Gillion/#adventurer-pull-plans","title":"Adventurer Pull Plans","text":"TheAxolotl's Pull Plan <p>Pretty easy pass here for me. The distance based damage and recoil damage are just too unreliable for me to consider running him.</p> Karkarov's Pull Plan <p>Drecom once again was cooking something but it is an acquired taste.  I used this analogy when discussing this character with others and will again.  Gillion is just like the Jean Claude Van Damme Street Fighter movie.  It's a terrible Street Fighter movie, but if you can convince yourself it isn't about Street Fighter and the similarities are just a coincidence you can have a great Tuesday by enjoying it for what it is.  A great schlocky B Movie where Raul Julia over delivers and owns the screen.  (RIP Raul).  If you can look past Gillions extremely niche limited use inheritable attack he is actually a very strong DPS unit with incredible party comp versatility due to his class, alignment, and element combo.  His visual design is also one of the best Drecom has delivered in my opinion and dead on target for the Wizardry theme.</p> <p>For new players, or really anyone that has not cleared at least a \"good ending\" in Abyss 3 I am not sure I can tell you to pull for anything but the design.  In fact I wont, don't pull if this is you.  For players who have cleared a \"good ending\" of abyss 3, have access to all the games best farm spots, and have been playing longer and may have the inherit and party depth options...

First, to mention the elephant in the room, he is not an actual Samurai despite the belief many folks had that the Samurai class would release with him. Instead, a new precedent was set where the collab adventurers were released with their own unique classes. In this case, The <code>Mage of the Black Rod</code> class is a mix between a Fighter and a Mage, gaining some interesting versatility while losing some key passive skills. Notably, Iarumas does not naturally have access to the damage multiplier provided by <code>Way of the Warrior</code>, nor does he naturally have access to the MP cost reduction provided by <code>Way of the Mage</code>. He also does not have access to the new <code>Full Power Strike</code> skill, which means he's missing the Fighter's most efficient physical damage attack. Iarumas' assortment of skills and spells makes him a unique and versatile damage dealer that can provide some additional support.</p> <p>Mage of the Black Rod is a very unique passive skill, as its function changes based on whether Iarumas is in the front row or the back row. Since a component of this skill requires being in combat, we can't see exact numbers of the stat increase and some of them are harder to calculate, but rough early math seems to indicate that this skill provides a boost of 15 Attack Power. This skill does appear to provide a static boost, which makes him hit comparatively strong with basic attacks early on, but that tapers off as he gains levels.</p> <p>His unique spell TZALIK has the potential to be extremely powerful. The fact that it deals major damage will put it above LA-spells in terms of magnitude, and its Magic Defense penetration will go ever farther to make it hit hard. The mana cost of 20 at base puts it roughly in line with a level 5 basic spell. This spell is a bit of a double edged sword, though. Like the CONES line, it's untyped which means it won't encounter any element type resistances. On the other hand, it won't deal weakness damage to anything. Furthermore, due to the lack of weakness damage, he won't be able to take advantage of the same type multiplier for having his element type match his attack's element type. One important thing to note is that this spell deals sure hits more frequently than other spells, both when Iarumas casts it and when it's inherited to another adventurer, regardless of the weapon equipped. It is unclear at this time if this is intended functionality. We know spells can sure hit, but we do not know if TZALIK is supposed to have an increased sure hit rate over other spells or not.</p> <p>Iarumas has quite a powerful kit and can fill the role of a very versatile damage dealer. Here are a few considerations in general:</p> <ul> <li>He does not have Full Power Strike, but he can gain access to Way of the Warrior through skill inheritance, which gives him a nice damage boost for his melee capabilities.</li> <li>He has the CONES line as well as TZALIK, which really emphasizes his magic damage, however his passive skill boosting stats while using 1h swords or staves puts him ideally in the front row with magic-based equipment, which is a potentially unique niche. He can exist in the back row, but that will effectively render his access to Follow-Up Attack and Counterattack irrelevant as sources of supplemental damage.</li> <li>He has Neutral typing, so he can benefit from Lanavaille, Alice, and Elise synergy buffs, as well as be relatively protected against row-switching mechanics.</li> <li>He has no Way of the Mage, so he might become MP starved in long fights. Furthermore, there is currently no easy or convenient way to regain MP while in dungeons, which could negatively impact his longevity. Hopefully this will be remedied with a future skill inherit.</li> </ul> <p>One big unknown is that we don't know if he will end up getting the Samurai class when that gets released in early Summer. We also don't know what future katanas will look like. His current role seems to be one of a front line magical damage dealer, which could be very fun and powerful, but he might have issues in longer dungeons or prolonged boss fights. Gearing him could also prove problematic since gearing for Magic Power is going to decrease his physical effectiveness, while gearing for Attack Power is going to decrease his magical effectiveness, and most of his current kit seems to support Magic Power being a focus. His lack of a heavy-hitting physical damage skill, outside of inheriting levels to Wild Strike, hinders his physical damage a bit, but not enough to render him obsolete by any means.</p> <p>Duplicate usage is also going to be unique with him. Normally, I like to prioritize inherits over discipline for duplicates, however high levels of TZALIK could result in a currently unsustainable MP cost, while discipline would give him a low amount of extra Attack Power, Magic Power, SP, and MP. On the other hand, if you're intending to use TZALIK as a situational nuke, increasing the damage it deals could be very impactful, despite the added cost.</p> <p>Iarumas is a very strong multi-purpose damage dealer with excellent Neutral and Void typing, and his kit is quite unique. You'll want to decide if his uniqueness and versatility is worth including in a party, though, as he faces some strong competition from more specialized adventurers.</p> Frobro's Analysis <p>At present, I\u2019m not a fan of these phys/mag hybrid units. In practice, they are middling fighters who lack Full Power Strike, have gear restrictions and effectively learn their mage spell tree without needing to class change. I think it\u2019s pretty telling that the unit that\u2019d be the best at this kind of setup, MC, doesn\u2019t get built like this because (unless your name is TheAxolotl) there are better ways to build him. Iarumas is getting access to samurai proper at a later date, so my mind may change.</p> <p>Judging him as he is, not bad. Drecom loaded his passives and gear with stats to ensure he could at least keep up with mages as a caster and fighters as a basic physical attacker. They did everything in their power to make him interesting. Tzalik is extremely strong and stat-creep-proof with the magic defense penetration effect and I guess the ability for it to surety is intended since they never patched it out. Being void is\u2026different, and being neutral aligned makes him splashable with most team comps.</p> Shiro's Analysis <p>Starting with his inheritance it\u2019s amazing. The only issue with it is\u2026 it wants surety\u2026 so you probably will never bring full potential from it on your mages\u2026 unless you build them around surety. Which collides with their skillset. The other issue with it is that it costs 20 MP. Less of an issue in abyss 3 but definitely an issue earlier on in the game. But if you build Iarumas as mage with 2h staff he\u2019s going to be able to burst some bulkier enemies.</p> <p>Moving to his passive. Not only is there a lot of text but there are some decent values. I\u2019m unsure if I would go with Saber over the option to run him with 2h staff as for now but it\u2019s still a great chunk of stats to make building him easier.</p> <p>Moving to his discipline. I don\u2019t have much to say there. Definitely one of the best ones we have as for now quite fitting the protagonist. A bit disappointed in no SUR in it despite TZALIK being SUR oriented skill but it\u2019s still a really good one thanks to how many stats it upgrades.</p> <p>To sum it up\u2026 Iarumas is a bit weird. His passives are more fighter-like oriented while abilities  he learns belong to a mage. His class also belongs to a mage letting him to be used in mage trials. It would be better if he had full access to fighter-mage passives but it\u2019s what it is. His spells are void type which is\u2026 quite bad. Sure you don\u2019t need to use Adam inherit to counter possible resistance but you\u2019ll also never have elemental advantage. Still, you can build him as a fighter and he works perfectly fine as one. Or you can build him like a samurai chasing as much mag and ATK as you can to run him with HA/DTS while having access to TZALIK. Overall I feel like they made Iarumas fitting his protagonist title and I do hope that he\u2019ll get access to samurai class when we get a rerun of the collaboration. After all, Iarumas without Samurai access feels kind of void. Joking aside, Iarumas is still a really solid option to use.</p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/details/Iarumas/#adventurer-pull-plans","title":"Adventurer Pull Plans","text":"TheAxolotl's Pull Plan <p>I like the Iarumas/Berkanan banner, so I pulled a decent amount on this one.

Not only does she provide defensive capabilities, her ability to buff a Good/Neutral row can be very powerful, particularly if you have a Good/Neutral MC. A front row of Lanavaille - MC - Debra/Gerard is very common at the moment, and all three units would benefit from the increased damage.</p> <p>In addition to her battle prowess, Lanavaille's end of battle heal is extremely valuable early game. While the initial heal amount is only 12, increasing the inheritance level will boost the heal value up to stay competitive as you progress throughout the game. This heal is often potent enough to allow you to save your healer's MP while grinding/farming or progressing through the story. The heal won't provide any real value during boss fights, but her damage boost will.</p> <p>If you have an evil MC, however, her value drops significantly.</p> <p>The newly fixed skills for Wandering Lanavaille are quite interesting, as they provide some nice minor buffs without fundamentally changing the character itself. The ASPD boost on Valiant Righteousness is very minimal at 2 ASPD per slot, however it only considers the weapon and chest armor slots. This means at most, you'll see a 4 ASPD boost.</p> <p>The changes to her Discipline nice - you should never say no to more HP, and Critical Tolerance will help prevent instant death, which is always good.</p> <p>Neither of these skill changes are game-breaking by any means, so if you don't like Lanavaille as an adventurer or you prefer her standard style, you won't really be missing out on anything by skipping her. If you like her, though, her Wandering Princess form is all around better than her standard form and going for a couple copies wouldn't be a bad idea at all.</p> <p>Wandering Lanavaille is the first adventurer that enables the merge option in the training room. This combines the two styles into a single adventurer and adds another passive skill that provides a very minor boost to a few stats. There is no real reason not to merge the two styles together. From there, you can choose which style you want to use.</p> <p>One key thing to note is that Discipline is tied to the particular style, so standard Lana dupes cannot be used to increase the Discipline of Wandering Princess Lana. This actually makes it an easy choice for standard dupe usage if you use Wandering Princess Lana, as inheriting standard Lana dupes to the merged Wandering Princess Lana will give the best value.</p> Frobro's Analysis Standard <p>Do I even need to explain this one? One of the few well-aligned party buffs in the game. That post-battle healing is incredibly strong. At level 1 it falls off after the early game which makes people think lowly of it, but it is great even at level 60 with just a few more levels. Assuming you use Lana, this isn\u2019t the worst use of Codexs around. I don\u2019t even bring a healer when auto-farming events anymore.</p> <p>The real kicker here is that to reach her full potential, you gotta switch Lana to fighter. (After learning all the knight stuff first) The downside is having to look at dork fighter Lana. The upside is that Wana exists. Besides looking better as a fighter, Wana also gets an ASPD boost with a gear-based conditional and turns Lana\u2019s \u201cwhatever\u201d discipline focus into \u201cwhatever\u2026but better\u201d. When merged, you only need to level the Queen of War and Love skill on one unit to apply it to both styles.</p> Shiro's Analysis StandardWandering Princess <p>Starting with inheritance. It's a really strong one for the early part of the game-mostly abyss one and two. But even when maxed out in the third abyss it feels like QoL at best and having it on her or your MC will rarely make difference in long run despite halved healing. Because either enemies don\u2019t do enough DMG and healing won\u2019t matter or they hit too hard and it\u2019s not enough. Never in the sweet spot to justify using Lana alone for it.</p> <p>Moving to her passive. It\u2019s good. Massively overrated to a point where people lose their heads saying you\u2019re not allowed to run an evil front but still good. But in practice? Unless you stack it with other % bonus passives like Madam or Elise you\u2019ll barely feel any difference in fights outside that light dopamine kick from slightly bigger numbers. Definitely not worth worrying about team comp just to run around it.</p> <p>Her discipline felt like absolute ass for a really long time till we got to the third abyss. And now it turned out to be actually a good one. Having charm/conf resistance will never go wrong and allows you to build faster immunity. Definitely worth investment after you\u2019re done maxing out her inheritance on her.</p> <p>Her class change is a fighter which is a massive upgrade to her. Once you\u2019ll get it there\u2019s no reason to go back to knight. Her lane buff starts to become more useful on her too as she\u2019ll be one of your main damage dealers with access to it.</p> <p>To sum it up. Lana is not game changing by any means but she\u2019s still a great solid pick. If you\u2019re running an evil team, kick her out or use her in the backlane for some auto farming setups with Abenius, Debra or whoever else you might use in the back as a neutral/good damage dealer. It was nice to have \u201cLana meta\u201d back in the days when we didn\u2019t have that many strong evil options and when her buff somehow makes for gaps in your equipment. Otherwise? Nothing worth losing your head about or panicking that you don\u2019t have her. But hey. She\u2019s good at buffing Liviana backlane damage.</p> <p>She gets some bonus ASPD from 1h sword, light armor and slightly more bulk on discipline. Nothing to write there over it.

As a big fan of 2h weapons in general, I've been exited about the idea of a 2h-focused Fighter since the game came out, and...this one is not what I had in mind at all.</p> <p>First, as a passive, <code>The One Who Enforces</code> is somewhat decent. Surety and Accuracy are two solid stats to increase for 2h axe usage, and the increase itself is a flat +7 of each. This is roughly equivalent to the gains of a Discipline 2 featured stat, being somewhat higher than Discipline 2 but not quite to the same value of Discipline 3.</p> <p>And while I'm mentioning Discipline, <code>Bloodline of the Mirror-Mere</code> is not that great. Accuracy is fine, but Magic Defense is lackluster, and neither are really worth focusing on. Discipline her if you want, but just remember that the gain per duplicate value is low.</p> <p>Her <code>Moonlit Pool of the White Daemon</code> is a fantastic skill. I'm not a huge fan of active skills as the signature skill on a damage-dealing adventurer in general since we never know what future skill could come along to render a signature skill largely irrelevant (I'm looking at you, Gerard), but I'm not quite as bothered by it in this case. This is mainly because her signature skill isn't going to be your main focus for dealing damage - instead, it'll be a situational utility attack. Being a moderate attack, the damage should be comparable to Gerulf's Eruption Strike and Gerard's Thunderstrike. As a water attack, it will also deal type-effective damage on par with Gerulf and stronger than Gerard due to Livana herself also being a water type. Just remember to inherit in Adam if you plan to use her to fight earth type enemies. In addition to ignoring range, this skill can apply Spell-Binding and is our first debuff focused on reducing an enemy's Magic Power.</p> <p><code>Moonlit Pool of the White Daemon</code> will ultimately allow you to treat her 2h axe (or whatever weapon, but if you're running her, you should be using a 2h axe) as a Bow and hit at any range. There is one big limitation with this skill, though - it is a forced single hit attack, which means if you're using her with a dagger or sword and a shield, she will still only deal one attack with it. That's pretty much a non-issue if you're using a 2h axe, but it's something to keep in mind, particularly if you want to inherit this skill to someone else. Unfortunately, this skill also does not seem to gain the damage increase that <code>Way of the Warrior</code> provides, likely due to it not being considered dealing close-range damage.</p> <p>One potential use case of inheriting <code>Moonlit Pool of the White Daemon</code> to a non-Livana adventurer would be to give it to a back-row adventurer (such as a mage, priest, knight, or thief) using the Staff of Weakness. Since this is a skill and not a spell, it would allow the adventurer to apply the Staff of Weakness debuff from the back row without an accuracy loss. Likely not the best action for a turn in most cases, but could occasionally be useful. With the latest 2h weapon changes, this becomes a substantial damage dealer even when inherited, and is widely considered a Priest's best source of single target damage.</p> <p>Also with the release of her second class as a Knight, she's arguably one of the best Legendary Knights in the game. On encounters such as 0 Corruption, superbosses, and sentries, it's practically impossible for Knight Livana to have a dead turn. Moonlit Pool allows her to deal full damage with her signature skill from the back row on turns when using Knight's Defense or Cover skills are not needed, which is a massive boon over many other Knights.</p> Frobro's Analysis <p>Full Disclosure: This unit\u2019s release prompted me to begin articulating my thoughts on how Drecom designs units with these reviews. Previously, Livana was aggressively mid. Now that 2-handed weapons got buffed with basically double damage and increased blessing values are on the way, this one needs to be re-evaluated.</p> <p>Problem 1: An awful discipline focus. Accuracy and Mag Def\u2026not Attack or Surety, even Action Speed would have been fine. Something unusual, like Luck, could have been strong to pair with Follow-up Attack. Mag Def on a premium unit\u2026What a joke!</p> <p>Problem 2: That active skill, Moonlit Pool of the White Daemon. Fighters want to use Full Power Strike when sustained damage is needed and Heavy Attack 3 when they need damage quickly. With all the data the devs have showing that skills like Thunder/Eruption Strike aren\u2019t used by players, why did they create a skill in the same vein but blue? Post-2-hand weapon buff, this skill is outrageous. It seems that the soft cap for this skill is incredibly high or nonexistent. Even when inherited, Mages/Priests with 2-hand staves can get relatively high damage from just lvl 1 of this skill (and surety). It does have some utility with ignoring the distance penalty, and the Magic Power debuff seems consistent even when inherited, but that part is less useful as there are few enemies you\u2019d really want that for. </p> <p>Problem 3: That Passive skill. +7 Accuracy and Surety when using a 2-handed axe is a joke. How did they release something like this when they already got it right with Iarumas\u2019s &amp; Berkanan\u2019s version of this? Their passives give them a boost to more than 2 stats at a potency comparable to decent blessings as if it were a shield or 2nd accessory and isn\u2019t limited to 1 weapon type. </p> <p>I anticipate this banner will be one of the worst-performing banners yet for Drecom. This is unadulterated \u201cMid\u201d; general adventurers like Elise and Benjamin are better than this. I have no idea what the devs were thinking when they came up with this; I guess they weren\u2019t. My best guess is that they are thinking ahead to what the legendary pool will look like when previous legends get mass demoted to the base pool and felt the need to dilute it with a new stinker. My bad; she\u2019s got a job now: Big Damage for 9sp.(need to use a 2-hand weapon)</p> Karkarov's Analysis <p>Livana is the poster child of \"If only Drecom changed one thing this character would be good!\"  With Livana on release two handed weapons just weren't good, and she is clearly designed to be using a two handed axe.  She needed two handed axes to be viable for her character design to work well.  As many have noticed by the time of this analysis (10/9/25), Drecom has changed the viability of two handed weapons in a big way.</p> <p>So let's get the bad out of the way first.  Livana, your discipline is ASS!!!1!111!  Ok it honestly is nowhere near as bad as people claim.  First off, you have to understand Legendaries have a higher base stat gain than non-legendaries on discipline.  A Livana at D9 gets the same Attack Power and Speed as a non-legendary Fighter who gets boosted Attack Power and Speed.  She would just also cremate them on every other stat and really crush them on Accuracy and Magic Defense.</p> <p>Wait did you say accuracy?  Isn't one of the biggest issues of two handers the fact that they only hit once, so a miss is far more damaging than with a multi-hit weapon?  So maybe boosted Magic Defense and Accuracy isn't as bad as people say, but yes it could have been better.  It's her worst feature, but it isn't a damning weakness, or two useless boosts like Magic Defense and Poison Resistance would have been.</p> <p>So let's get to the good.  She may have no Surety in her discipline but she sure gets free Surety when using a two hand axe thanks to her passive \"The One Who Enforces\".  It even gives more Accuracy with a two handed axes as well.  Considering two handed axes also have defense pen this kind of makes them the best front line two handed weapon, so this is a great uninheritable passive for a Fighter or Knight.</p> <p>Next we have her element.... Water.  This isn't blowing my mind or anything, but considering there are earth users in abyss 1 and 3 I don't see it being much of a thing in abyss 4.  Also while water isn't beastly for Abyss 2, you certainly won't be weak to much in there either.  The fact that the easiest and lowest level Den is also Earth.... well Water probably has some legs on it for the future and isn't a handicap in any of the nastiest content right now.  Also worth a fast mention... Good Alignment means she plays nice with the Lana buff as well.</p> <p>How about that \"Moonlit Pool of the White Daemon\" her inheritable attack?  Well it comes with free range on it so it can be used from the back row or front safely.  On the damage front when used with a two hander it outperforms Heavy Attack and basically everything not called Full Power Strike from an SP to Damage perspective.  (Catch 22, Raging King if buffed by attacks does out perform SP to Damage here, but again, it needs the buff from being attacked).  It can also debuff with Magic Attack Down and outright Magic Skill lock an enemy, even better.... this is actually a fairly common event.  I would say at least 50% of the time it applies one or the other assuming it doesn't kill the enemy.  It can also apply both on one hit if you get really lucky.  The skill bind does seem to be rarer of the two though.  The only real draw back is that it is a water elemment attack, so you probably want to inherit 1 Adam just to ensure you never have a water resist issue with the skill.  That said it does so much damage it can easily score over 2k surety hits at level 1 with a two hander even with only so-so 500 attack power gear.  At higher levels it has shown over 4k with 800+ attack and no other set up or buffs on surety.  In short, for Livana, you really never need to FPS anymore unless you want to conserve SP.  Even if for some reason you hate Livana as a character this skill is so good serves as a viable inherit option for your priests, mages, or other back row DPS because it has the range built into it even when procced with a melee weapon.</p> <p>In short, this skill by itself is a great reason to pull Livana, because while it does lose some damage on inherit, it is not so much that it ceases to be viable.  In fact testing shows it still keeps up with or beats heavy attack as an inherit until Heavy Attack passes it in SP cost.  IE HA 5 VS Moonlit 3.  It is simply one of the better attack inherits in the game.  Much like Raging King.</p> <p>So we have a great passive uninheritable skill, a great inherit skill, her alt class is revealed as Knight which has strong fighter synergy, and her Moonlit toss is so good you kinda don't miss FPS on knight anymore.  Even as a Fighter you will prefer the toss over FPS except in extreme SP conservation situations.  I hate to say it everyone, but Livana is an ugly duckling that grew into a sexy swan. As far as I am concerned she is now one of the best fighters in the game, and from a raw DPS perspective might be the best Fighter in the game.  She definitely has the highest Knight DPS potential as a stock character save maybe Galbadus after he gets attacked say 3 times.  Best part, all she needs is normal fighter inherits and 1 Adam.  She might have some spotty moments with some enemies in Abyss 3, but she should be good to go everywhere else in current game content.  Sure her discipline could be better, but there is nothing else wrong with her in todays two hander economy, and a whole lot that is very right. </p> Shiro's Analysis <p>Back in the day we joked that human-fighter was better than her. Now things have changed.</p> <p>Starting with her inheritance. Past 2h weapon buff it became arguably the best DPT option with reasonable SP cost to inherit. DMG wise on par with Eruption Strike while lacking weapon restriction. On top of that it ignores range penalty and debuff MATK. Not as strong DPT wise as Astral Break but definitely a really hard hitting ability that can hit ranged targets no matter of the weapon you use. On top of that the SP cost is really low. It was a solid option back then, now it\u2019s great. My only beef with it is that skill sealing is niche at best. Because every enemy that depends on it has immunity to it. Unless you\u2019re B&amp;B collab dragon who happens to be weak to water. But oops. He was before Livana was released.</p> <p>Moving on her passive. It\u2019s not much but it\u2019s definitely enough of an upgrade over passive that Gerulf has to put him to shame. Especially good thanks to the 2h axe being the best weapon option in the game as for now (2025). </p> <p>Moving to discipline. I won\u2019t say much there because that\u2019s her weakest part. It\u2019s bad and completely ignorable.</p> <p>Her class change is a knight which is the best she could get and what some people hoped for. There\u2019s not much more to say. More bulk and access to knight defense gives her no dead turns as a backrow option.</p> <p>To sum it up. Livana is in a great spot now, especially as a knight. She along with Galbados are best knight DPT options that either hit like a truck or use knight defense depending on the needs. While skill on lvl 1 is worse SP wise and comparable at best to FPS DPT wise it doesn\u2019t have turn to load unlike FPS. Which makes it way more stable and a better option for DPT which pushes her even more as a knight because she doesn\u2019t need any other option for damage. On top of that she can use 2h axes in backrow without issues thanks to it giving her access to the best weapon type in the game without range penalty. Definitely one of the best knights and one of the better fighters in the game at this moment. She\u2019s one of two characters that benefit the most with recent buffs along with Gerulf.</p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/details/Livana/#adventurer-pull-plans","title":"Adventurer Pull Plans","text":"TheAxolotl's Pull Plan <p>Her kit is just interesting enough to me that I might pull a bit in anticipation of having to worry about long range damage in the future.

He's a great adventurer to skip in order to save for whatever we get in the anniversary! With that out of the way, let's dig into his kit a bit.</p> <p>First, we'll talk about his Bones of Obsessive Love passive. This is pretty lackluster. Yes, he restores MP when he kills something (2 MP, I believe). No, this is not inheritable. No, priests won't often have the turns available to deal damage. No, even when it happens, priests won't often be the ones to land the kill. I love MP restoration, but I can't imagine he'd be landing enough kills to make it worthwhile. One important thing to note is that even though his signature spell deals damage to a row, if you kill more than 1 enemy with that spell, he only gets a restoration amount equal to one enemy. There also seems to be a bug where his spell is the only thing that triggers this restoration. That will likely get fixed, but still - not great.</p> <p>Now, let's talk about his Alchemized Anima Dissolution spell. This is weird. First, it's a combination of a MA damaging spell a MA healing spell, where the damage can be targeted against either row, but the heal is only for the front row, regardless of position. This isn't that bad since the front row is likely what's needing healing the most. Early tests seem to indicate that at skill level 1, when he uses it, the heal is somewhere around 40% of the damage dealt and the damage is roughly 10 damage per PIE, while it gets used by someone else through inherit, the heal is closer to 15%, with roughly 6-7 damage per PIE. The fact that this is PIE-based is the strange part, since there's nothing we can currently do with gear to improve it. It's literally as static of a heal as possible, however it has a comparatively high MP cost. The one benefit of having it be locked to PIE is that he's not reliant on Divine Power to heal. This would let you effectively build him as a battle priest.</p> <p>His Discipline is also weird in that it's the first Discipline we've seen that boosts a Trait (Piety) instead of a stat. Unfortunately, Piety is up there with Vitality as a very underwhelming Trait to boost.</p> <p>Keeping this short for now, and I might add more later. I love the idea of his kit. I think it's really fun and would be a welcome addition, however the implementation of it is what is strange. A priest isn't going to be able to do too much with this due to having better things to spend their turns on, and having the damage+heal locked to Piety is a bizarre choice. Even if you wanted to run a damage priest, the MC or Abenius could fit that bill easier. The one saving grace I could see is that you could literally gear him out as a DPS, complete with damage-oriented skill inherits, and his healing won't be negatively impacted. He could actually make a decent battle priest, however there are much better ways across the board to provide better damage and utility.</p> Frobro's Analysis <p>Another awesome design from the art team, let\u2019s see how the devs waste it. </p> <p>MP Regen Passive. Now that\u2019s a start! Only after a kill. There it is\u2026 What is the idea here? A Marianne-style MP cost reduction is more effective than this. Are we supposed to put him in the front row to try and last hit scrubs with a staff/mace for\u2026checks notes\u20264MP? I\u2019m speechless.</p> <p>Well, at least they gave him a button to click that isn\u2019t Badios in Alchemized Anima Dissolution. 20MP for a row target spell + front line healing is probably a fair deal, but I\u2019m struggling to see when I\u2019d ever want that. Seriously, can someone point me to the exact enemy formation I\u2019d want this for? On top of that, for some reason, they scaled it off Piety; which basically keeps it\u2019s potency capped at around whatever his current level is. I assume you\u2019re better off leveling the spell up to do more damage to get around potential softcaps than doing that anyway.</p> <p>Which brings me to the final point; the MP/Piety discipline focus. All this does is mentally prepare us for the day we get a unit that has a Luck discipline. I always hoped any lich/necromancer type guy we\u2019d get would be something really cool, like having a spell that resurrects non-reversed fallen allies that turn them into uncontrollable units that spam the undead enemy-only skills for 0sp. Instead, we get a normal priest with an expensive AOE life drain spell.</p> Karkarov's Analysis <p>Raffalmao to his credit is one of the coolest charater designs drecom has done to date, it might even be my favorite.  I guess I covered the good...</p> <p>So there is a lot to unpack here. An untyped aoe line attack spell for priest, sweet!  It even heals for give or take 15-17% of damage dealt to the front line of your party.  Cool!  It's damage scales off of... Piety.  WAT?  Not Magic Attack, not even Divine Power, your literal Piety trait/stat.  Well there went any hope of this spell being great DPS, but you know priest's don't have a line attack at all and inheriting line mage spells is costly and not always easy right?  What's that MP cost?  Level 1 Spell, does a little less than mahalito level 1, heals maybe almost madios 1 to front line.... 20 @$@!%&amp;*# MP?</p> <p>Suffice to say this was a good idea on drecom's part, I like where they were going with it.  But damage and healing are a bit too weak to justify that MP cost, and when compared to say 20 MP level 1 Tzalik a spell that could reach 2k surety hits, doing like 400 line damage and healing for 150ish doesn't seem to be as good for the same casting cost.</p> <p>But WAIT!  Raffalcopter has an MP Regen skill!  We are saved!  Huh... only regens 2 #$@%$#@! MP on kill?  Even if you kill multiple enemies it's still only 2 MP?  Insult to injury, because this is the unique uninheritable skill you can't even level it to maybe get uh.... 4 MP?  Both Shelirionach and Marianne have better MP management skills for Priest casting.  This skill is simply lack luster and does not recover enough MP on it's own.  The fact that it requires a kill also makes it unreliable.  Oh, and don't forget, it has to be a kill via damage.  Killing an undead with say Marien doesn't count.</p> <p>Lets remain positive, what about that discipline?  That can change this whole conversation you know what I am saying?  It's increased MP and the actual raw trait/stat of Piety.</p> <p>I am sorry I was wrong, let's not remain positive.  It is interesting that this is the first character to ever boost a raw trait (str, iq, pie, etc) as a discipline, and sure it buffs his spells damage due to it being purely Piety based, but good god it isn't useful at all otherwise.  Almost anything would have been better.</p> <p>In summary this guy seems to have an awesome backstory.  His design is legitimately cool.  The concept drecom pursued for this character was honestly solid, different, very creative, and commendable.  Sadly their execution was not quite so hot.  I really wish I could say this character is good, but he isn't.  So before I ended this by saying, who knows maybe his alt class will change this story?  It didn't, his alt class is theif.  Raffaello has been consigned to the doom of a pure support character with a weird niche of wanting to be front row with a two hand hammer as a priest.  He just doesn't work in hardly any comp, his skill is cool but nothing special plus not good on inherit, and his two classes just have horrible synergy.  This guy is a pass for any player who isn't in love with his character concept/design or obsessed with an all evil team.</p> Shiro's Analysis <p>Starting with his inheritance. It's a really solid damage option outdamaging 500 MATK mage lvl 3 MA spell (17 cost) while costing Raffaello 20 with 4 return every turn he kills something additionally giving front lane healing depending on numbers of target hit. Really strong inheritance on himself thanks to his ability to hit high piety especially with discipline.</p> <p>Moving on his passive. It\u2019s 4 MP return per kill. Which gives him the ability to be a really good adventurer with a 2h hammer when it comes to the general content of the game. Really solid option for a priest with access to AoE.</p> <p>Moving to his discipline. So far it\u2019s the best IMO discipline for priests. PIE+MP. Not only does it give better scaling with Priest Weapon Mastery but it also goes really well with the second abyss book giving him a bit better survivability. </p> <p>As for class change I do hope it\u2019s a knight. While a fighter would make him a better frontline it won\u2019t go well with his PIE. And while mage would be nice thanks to MP regen per kill it doesn\u2019t go well with him having a fire element and he\u2019ll need to fight with other strong priest-mages like Alice, Adam or Sheli.</p> <p>To sum it up. Raffaello feels like a test towards bringing something close to lord class in future. Giving him access to strong PIE scaling aoe which doesn\u2019t need DIV to keep the DMG and healing letting him to be frontline physical damage dealer fully. Who will use his AoE for occasional emergency situations. In the future getting a knight will push him to better sport as a physical damage option while giving him access to magic AoE that will scale with knight PIE. The only issue being will be the MP pool which will need to be covered by relics/gear. He might not be the best option as for now but I do love the idea of him playing and in my completely biased option he's a really good pick. Especially if you grab PIE IV, and his gacha gear to push his potential damage from PWM and survivability from the second abyss book so he can be a great frontline option.</p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/details/Raffaello/#adventurer-pull-plans","title":"Adventurer Pull Plans","text":"TheAxolotl's Pull Plan <p>Definitely saving for the anniversary.</p> Karkarov's Pull Plan <p>If you love the design of this character or you are just someone that has to get a copy of every character for their roster, ok, I get it.

This lets him fit well in the front row with Lana or in the back row with Alice and not mess up their row buffs.</p> <p>His Apostle of Breaking Commandments skill provides some nice resistances for himself and any adjacent dark allies. The weird thing about this is that as a priest, he's usually going to be in the back row, which can force you to decide between placing him in the middle to allow him to buff three dark allies, which prevents you from placing a mage in the middle to leverage their secret art. If you place him on an edge, he can only buff two allies. You can also place him in the front row, but the limitation there is that Priests have limited equipment options compared to other physical damage dealers and they have a reduced Strength to Attack Power modifier, which means he'll have overall lower attack and not be able to take full advantage of his own unique spell.</p> <p>His Prayer of Rebellion spell, in a vacuum, is very powerful since it provides both a powerful offensive buff and a conditionally useful defensive buff for three turns. As a row-wide attack power boost that can be targeted, it allows you to cast this on your front line in turn 1 and have that line start attacking on turn 1 with boosted attack power. No need to spend a turn casting Warrior's Battle Cry first.</p> <p>In practice, though, there are a few major limitations with it that make it less appealing. The first is that you can only apply three buffs at a time. You'll likely want to be using MACALDIA, which already takes up two slots, so the order you apply the two buffs is crucial. I haven't confirmed this myself, but apparently the Resistance buff ends up ahead of the Attack buff on the list, so if you want to keep the Attack Power, Accuracy, and Surety buffs from the combination of MACALDIA and Prayer of Rebellion, you MUST cast Prayer of Rebellion first, that way MACALDIA will knock the Resistance buff off the list. If Red Beard is your only buffer, this isn't really an issue however if you're using two buffers, you'll need to pay close attention to speed tuning so Red Beard always goes first, assuming you want to apply both buffs on the same turn.</p> <p>The magnitude of the Attack Power boost from Prayer of Rebellion seems to be comparable to, if not a bit lower than that of Warrior's Battle Cry at the same skill level, with Warrior's Battle Cry significantly easier to get a higher skill level of through inheritance. It is possible to stack Warrior's Battle Cry with Prayer of Rebellion, which can be great if you don't need the Surety or Accuracy from MACALDIA, but most people are probably not in that situation, so MACALDIA would likely still be more valuable to them.</p> <p>If inherited to a different adventurer, Prayer of Rebellion will see a reduction in magnitude of the buff as well as a 1 turn count reduction. This turn count reduction is less than ideal since that can mess with your buff rotation and force you to delay reapplying it if you don't want to knock an important buff off the list. If inherited to Alice or someone with her skill, the two will offset each other at level 1, resulting in the buff lasting 3 turns while other buffs would last 4 turns.</p> <p>He's a solid pass for me, personally. I think his buff, while nice, is limited from its full potential by core game mechanics and he won't provide anything overly unique to my party that can't already be achieved, with potentially better and easier-to-work-with results, with other party members like Alice.</p> Frobro's Analysis <p>I like the idea of something unorthodox, but it just isn\u2019t as effective here. Red Beard is kind of a front-line back-up priest. Male/Dwarf + that Divine Power and Attack discipline point to him being a strong attacker, but when stuck with the weapon restrictions Priests have, he kinda has to be in the front. Fortunately, as a neutral unit, he doesn\u2019t break one of the few well-aligned front-row buffs.</p> <p>He has relatively low MP for a priest and low SP compared to other physically inclined units, meaning you can\u2019t rely on him being your only healing source in extended runs and he doesn\u2019t have the resources to use high-level inherited skills like Heavy Attack to make up for priest\u2019s lack of offense phys damage.</p> <p>The Prayer of Rebellion buff sounds cool, but in reality, it is okay at best. Attack buff feels unimpactful and it takes up 2 buff slots with the Res add-on. Macaldia is preferable unironically. The Dark Adjacent Instakill + Omnibind resist is cool, but not enough to make him an appealing bring.</p> <p>Priests are better in the back with tons of MP, and the front line is reserved for units that can put up big physical damage and Red is neither of those. Wouldn\u2019t suggest using unless you\u2019re dead set on having a mono-dwarf team. Getting Knight as an alt class gave him a real job as a Knight\u2019s Defense/Prayer of Rebellion Spammer and back status cleanser.</p> Shiro's Analysis <p>Starting with inheritance we have access to one of the best buffs in the game for bossing purposes only. Both ATK and res up are there to make it easier to build up immunity with gear or disciplines that have resistance to these statues while allowing you to ignore them in your gear completely. Outside of bosses who use statuses, his inheritance loses value because of the 3 buff limit.</p> <p>His passive is solid. Works well with Sheli or Miliana. But it\u2019s not appealing enough in my eyes to think about bringing him to a team for that purpose.</p> <p>His discipline pushed DIV and ATK which confused everyone to a point where devs themselves named his class to change a fighter in a game as a bug. But he ended up as a knight. Which is better of him but kind of stings that it went in this direction instead of lore accuracy.</p> <p>His class change is knight which just settled him as \u201cbest\u201d niche pick. I wouldn\u2019t use him generally but if someone likes to min max their fights then here he is. Good option vs Sealed Demon or Morgus.</p> <p>To sum it up. Red Beard's purpose is to be a backlane knight who uses his buff for the team and then he sits on knight defense. Basically build on dark super bosses. When it comes to this no one beats him. But\u2026 It's a niche. And I feel that most of the community won\u2019t even attempt superbosses. And those who do have probably enough of an investment in other picks. So in the end he\u2019s best at doing something really specific. And that\u2019s the only thing he does well. In my personal opinion he\u2019s either skip or inheritance for Alice.

In addition to the ninja skill kit, which is already strong, Rinne has a few really big standouts.</p> <p>Enlightenment of the Brink of Death is the first true support we get for an Evil MC (and Evil characters in general). While the magnitude is tricky to determine, increasing Surety is always good. The buff will always be active for her, and \"adjacent\" in this game means on either side, as well as in front or behind. This gives her a lot of versatility in terms of position placement. Right now, the prime targets for her buff are an Evil MC, Gerulf, and Milana. This actually enables us to run aa full Evil party that could consist of Evil MC, Rinne, and Gerulf in the front row, and Milana, Alice, and Adam in the back row. This party would have both rows buffed by Alice, Milana providing an additional damage buff to the Evil MC, and Rinne providing a Surety buff to Evil MC, herself, and Gerulf in the front. One important thing to note is that she will always receive the Surety buff from this skill - it won't disappear if she's surrounded by Neutral or Good adventurers.</p> <p>Moment of Finality is a very unique ability. It is a skill that deals untyped spell damage on an entire enemy row, which initially is pretty solid, but is made stronger by the fact that it bypasses the enemy Magic Defense AND is based on Attack Power instead of Magic Power. Based on the skill details, the Magic Defense bypass rate is increased based on skill level, so while this needs testing, it likely behaves in the same way that Precision Strike and Armor Pierce do, but targeting Magic Defense instead of Defense. This gives a fantastic way for Rinne to get around high defense enemies, and it also gives us one of our first row attacks based on Attack Power. Furthermore, since it's based on SP, inheriting Debra to Rinne will allow for a boost to longevity through restoring SP on kill. This skill is likely not as valuable when inherited due to the damage loss, however it is a solid target for duplicate usage on Rinne herself.</p> <p>Rinne's Inheritor of the Secret Arts Discipline skill is also pretty solid in that it boosts her Surety, which is always welcome.</p> <p>In addition to the all-Evil party I mentioned above, Rinne can fit in a variety of teams, and she can function well in either the front row with Daggers or in the back row with Throwing Ninja Tools. She can also use Ninja Katanas effectively, as of release, we don't know if the Katanas are treated as Daggers for the Ninja Dual Wield skill or not. She can provide damage, support, and all around general utility with the other great Ninja active and passive skills.</p> <p>While Rinne herself may not be a meta-defining adventurer, the Ninja class initially seems extremely strong and Rinne provides enough uniqueness with her kit to make me highly recommend her as a pull target for those that have been saving their gems for a while.</p> Frobro's Analysis <p>Warning to newer players, ninjas are cool but are not for you. Their high EXP requirements will keep them under-leveled relative to the rest of your party. By the time your non-advanced classes reach lvl 60, your ninja will be at lvl 46. Veteran players have access to potent exp dispatches that can get one from level 0 to 60 in ~11 days. This martial training dispatch becomes available at Abyss 3 Zone 5. Don\u2019t let the newly added ninja junk in fool you, you woun\u2019t get access to solid ninja junk until you unlock the cave in Abyss 3.</p> <p>Now to Rinne specifically. Because of the potency drop when inherited, Moment of Finality is really only useful when used by her, which gives her a niche as the only non-mage multitarget attacker at present. However, the skill is kinda costly at 15SP, which means it isn\u2019t the kind of skill you can use very often. Rinne only gets 1 recovery event if multiple units die to Moment of Finality from inheriting Debra\u2019s Sp regen skill. Thanks to the 2-hand weapon buff, when made into a thief with a bow, Moment of finality can do some solid damage when geared right (a lot of atk blessings). Rinne also has a relatively deep pool of MP with nothing to use it on naturally. I suppose you could use her in a buffer/debuffer role by using premium scrolls like Batilgref/Dilto/Marein/Masolotu/Cortu from the daily shop on her.</p> <p>Her Enlightenment at the Brink of Death passive gives her and adjacent Evil units free surety. Stuff like this is why Evil is drowning and Good is starving. The surety &amp; accuracy discipline is potent for Dual Wielding Daggers or Kunai; no complaints.</p> <p>Right now, ninjas are flashy but take a lot of investment and junk grinding to compare with fighters. Now that MC gets access to Ninja, things are even worse for Rinne as we don\u2019t need her for Dissipation and her use case shrinks even more. An inspired voice performance and a top 5 character model on a kinda middling unit.</p> Shiro's Analysis <p>Starting with inheritance. It's a spell. So you need to have a lot of surety to hit surety hits on it. But it scales with ATK. It's kind of disappointing for me why it didn\u2019t get the TZALIK treatment but looking at how strong it\u2019s I guess it\u2019s fair. Because it puts mages high lvl MA spells to a shame even at lvl 1.</p> <p>Moving to passive. It\u2019s solid. Surety but only for evil characters. Would be better if that includes neutral but it\u2019s what it\u2019s.</p> <p>Moving to discipline. It\u2019s great. ACC is kind of fine but SUR makes it really worth the investment when you\u2019re going to max out Rinne. Especially since thanks to her classes she\u2019ll have a good bunch of surety letting her to get close to hit surety with her AoE or have stable surety hits on bosses.</p> <p>Her class change is a thief. Back in the day, it was the worse option, that was nowhere close to ninja. Now? It\u2019s her better choice. Even if you have the most crazy ebon kunai they won\u2019t be hitting as hard as a bow. Bow scaling with skill at this moment completely outshine kunai giving a lot of damage difference on skills. So unless you use her for basic attacks only or you have a high lvl Ninja Dual Wield then it\u2019s not worth going for her ninja class. Especially when bows are much easier to farm.</p> <p>To sum it up. Rinne has a great class setup, She has great inheritance, she has great discipline, and her passive is solid. On top of that she has a dark element resulting in good state in the late part of abyss 3 fights. She's a solid investment and arguably the best thief and ninja option as for now. And unless devs won\u2019t come with anything crazy she\u2019s quite safe from risk of powercreep. It\u2019s also a good idea to grab MoF on your fighters to make farming a bit faster with AoE spam. Otherwise go ahead and invest in Rinne.</p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/details/Rinne/#adventurer-pull-plans","title":"Adventurer Pull Plans","text":"TheAxolotl's Pull Plan <p>While I'm not a whale, Rinne has easily been my biggest banner investment.

It's an evasion self-buff that also acts as a \"taunt\" with a counterattack. Like Attract Hit and Defensive Provoke, this is not a guarantee that she gets attacked if a single target physical attack would be used. It's possible that it has a higher chance that the aforementioned skills, but that's hard to confirm. It's still nice even though it's not a guarantee, but  unfortunately there are two other main limitations.</p> <p>First, this is a skill and is not treated as a basic attack, which means it is going to be subject to the logarithmic nature of active skill damage and cannot trigger Follow-Up Attack. Second, it will only work for single target, physical attacks. It will not protect at all against <code>MA</code> or <code>LA</code> level attacks, and it will not protect at all against spells.</p> <p>By default, the \"taunt\" portion of Black Beast Feint lasts for 2 turns (the turn you cast it and the following turn), while the counterattack portion lasts for one turn.  If you combine Black Beast Feint and Blessing of Agora, however, both see a single turn increase, leading the \"taunt\" to last for 3 turns and the counterattack to last for two. This puts Savia in a very unique position of being able to use Black Beast Feint on the first turn, then defend on the second turn. Her Defending will activate the Opening status, while her counterattack will cause Opening damage from her skill. This combination makes her extremely potent for dealing with heavy single target attackers like Cyclopses, as well as groups of single target attackers like Chimera.</p> <p>An added benefit is that this skill can act as a one point wonder inherit for any adventurer you want to put in the position of being an Opening activator, as there is no reduction in counterattack chance when inherited to someone other than Savia.</p> <p>Her Soaring Beast Knight skill likely is similar to Wandering Lana's skill in that the buff is relatively minor at just a few points, and only considers the weapon slot and the chest armor slot.</p> <p>Her Discipline skill is a decent defensive boost, but not having any extra offensive boost is less than ideal.</p> <p>Overall, she's received quite a bit of indirect love since she was released, and she's certainly more viable now. Her longevity will depend quite a bit on how many future encounters rely on single target physical attacks and how many incorporate regular spell damage and MA/LA targeting physical attacks. In addition, she's still a Knight and will be fairly SP-starved.</p> Frobro's Analysis <p>What a sick-looking unit, right? Is she a cat; a wolf\u2026who knows? Well, that\u2019s almost it for the pros, now to the cons. Knight isn\u2019t in a great place as I write this. Their 1 claim to fame is Knight\u2019s Defence and she\u2019s not much better at using that than any other knight aside from having a deeper SP pool. Thief for a secondary class gives her surety/evasion-related passives, and precision strike, which are useful.</p> <p>Black Beast Feint is like a better Defensive Provoke. Better in that the evasion buff it grants is better than a defense buff, and the counter-hit has def-penetration, which along with the 2-hand weapon buff means this can do solid damage. Unfortunately, it's still kinda whack because the aggro effect doesn\u2019t feel particularly potent and a good chunk of named enemy attacks can\u2019t be countered at all.</p> <p>The Soaring Beast Knight passive isn\u2019t so bad now that 2-handed weapons like Spears are in style! Her discipline focus is interesting; that \u201cgreatly\u201d increased evasion is no joke; I forget the exact numbers, but it\u2019s something absurd at the high end. It\u2019s like she has a double evasion discipline.</p> <p>This chick is an easy skip unless you need a Dark Knight for Abyss 3 superbosses and even then, there are options like Galbadus, Red Beard, Gerard and Eldorado. As a backrow Evil Knight, she\u2019ll still be able to put up numbers while getting Dark/Evil synergies from units like Alice, Rinne, Red Beard, Arboris and Milana.</p> Shiro's Analysis <p>Starting with inheritance. It\u2019s really a good hard hitting counter. Working well with Savia access to 2h weapons (especially spear or bow) and while a bit of rng based because of how taunt works still does it\u2019s job thanks to cover abilities. On top of that it boosts her evasion, letting her be an even better evasive knight. I personally don\u2019t know if I would give her inheritance to anyone else. Maybe Debra. But it\u2019s worth considering to lvl it on Savia.</p> <p>Moving to her passive while not highly impactful pushes her further towards being an evasion tank. It works well with spear and Le Bicken armor letting her to get decent evasion just with those 2 alone.</p> <p>Moving to her discipline I personally love it because of how strong the evasion number is and how I do love to use evasion units. It allows her to hit really high and absurd evasion values, besting thieves as a knight.</p> <p>Her class change is a thief which is amazing for her. Not only does it further boost her performance as evasion knight is also buffed her damage thanks to surety accessibility. On top of that she gets PS from the thief for the single target damage option. You might as well use her as a thief with a bow but that\u2019s not the best way to use her IMO. Though she still performs as a better counter thief than one other character without access to taunt (Yes Aldric. I\u2019m looking at you).</p> <p>To sum it up. Savia's best performance will be knight with a mix of her counter+cover abilities. She had shown to be able to hit quite hard even against some bosses with DEF up.  Even better if we are facing physical bosses with multiple attacks (like Elmon second cave). Sadly to perform well she needs lvl 1 Alice inherit and preferably lvl 5 to put the best use of her rotations. On top of that, a good bunch of bosses seem to use magic attacks. So unless Savia counters won\u2019t get some kind of rework she\u2019s just a regular knight on those. But thanks to being a dark element she\u2019s never a bad option in your team.</p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/details/Savia/#adventurer-pull-plans","title":"Adventurer Pull Plans","text":"TheAxolotl's Pull Plan <p>Savia was a pass for me on release.

This skill can trigger multiple times within a turn, once for each enemy that attacks her. During testing we saw sequences of her evading an attack followed by her receiving reduced damage from two additional attacks within the same turn. This is quite noteworthy, as in theory, she could evade multiple times in a row, really adding to her defensive protections. Mechanically, this skill seems to work by having an <code>X%</code> chance of evading and a <code>1-X%</code> chance of reducing damage. As the skill level increases, the chance to evade increases and the chance to reduce damage decreases. This is quite powerful as more evades means a higher overall uptime of protection, but it's not clear how impactful each level increase would be.</p> <p>When inherited, there is a significant reduction in the activation rate, so it's likely not going to be too helpful when given to other adventurers, but something worth considering for the whales out there.</p> <p>This is fine since her Discipline is one of the stronger ones. While I'm not a big fan of Disciplines in general, <code>Child of the Sacred Tree</code> works great for Sheli since it boosts her two most important stats - Magic Power for more damage and Action Speed for maintaining optimal turn order.</p> <p>The real interesting mechanic, though, is with her signature skill, <code>Dream of the Sleeping Witch</code>. This skill has a lot of nuance to it, making for a very interesting skill. First, it helps alleviate one of the major issues that mages face right now - longevity in long dungeon exploration sessions. If Sheli is below 25% MP at the end of her turn, she will put herself to sleep. While sleeping, she performs two actions automatically - the first is that she nukes an enemy with a dark attack. This attack hits significantly harder than a manually-cast <code>ZELOS</code>. The second action is that she restores a flat 8 MP. This doesn't scale, but it can add up over a long time. If she ends up sleeping for 5 turns in a fight for some reason, she will restore 40 MP, and while she can only put herself to sleep once in the course of a given battle, she can put herself to sleep multiple times over the course of a given dungeon exploration session.</p> <p>There's a specific sequence of events that occur here. We need to verify this completely, but I believe the order of events is:</p> <ol> <li>If Sheli is asleep, perform her sleepy nuke.</li> <li>If Sheli is awake, take an action like normal.</li> <li>If Sheli is awake and meets the MP threshold criteria, she goes to sleep.</li> <li>If Sheli is asleep, she restores 8 MP.</li> <li>If Sheli is asleep, there's a chance for her to wake up.</li> </ol> <p>One important thing to note about this sequence is that early testing shows that if she puts herself to sleep, she's guaranteed to stay asleep that first turn, so you are guaranteed to get 8 MP back. If a fight lasts 2 turns and she puts herself to sleep on turn 1, she is guaranteed to restore 16 MP as long as she's not woken up before her second turn comes.</p> <p>In addition to the MP restore and damage boost, she will not take double damage from attacks made against her while she's asleep. This is quite significant and will go a long way to helping a squishy elf mage stay alive.</p> <p>One key thing to think about with this skill is that the MP restore and the sleepy nuke will happen regardless of the source of her nap. This effectively means if you're in a fight where <code>KATINO</code> or <code>Eye of Torpor</code> gets used against you, she does not have a dead turn, as she's immediately perform her sleepy nuke when her turn came around.</p> <p>Shelirionach's kit is extremely interesting and nuanced. While it won't help a ton during the course of a boss fight, the MP restore can be quite impactful while progressing through a new map. In addition, her race, element, and Discipline are all very favorable towards her role as a damage dealing mage. Also note that while she does have access to <code>LAZELOS</code>, Sheli is the first legendary mage that does not have a <code>Secret Art</code> spell, so you won't get a boosted <code>LAZELOS</code>. I certainly don't consider her a must-pull, but I do personally think she has the strongest kit of any damage-oriented mage released thus far. If you have any spare Iarumas' around, Shelirionach makes an excellent recipient of a <code>TZALIK</code> inherit.</p> Frobro's Analysis <p>I will not mince words here; nor will I exaggerate. Shelirionach is the strongest mage in the game by a large margin. Shelirionach would occupy an S tier by herself if a tier list were constructed for units by class. Fundamentally, she plays an entirely different game than the rest of the field, and the game she plays is much more effective than what other mages have access to. Shelirionach was created by scientists in a lab to be as optimized as possible.</p> <p>Let\u2019s start from the top. Dark/Evil/Mage/Elf/Female gives her a min-maxed stat line and access to synergy buffs from units like Milana, Alice, Arboris, Rinne, Elda, Emil and Red Beard. At the current end-game, (Post Abyss 3) Dark resist is the best resist to have and no boss attacks with the Light element. Her discipline focus stats are Magic Power and Action Speed; the ideal set.</p> <p>Onto the secret sauces. Dream of the Sleeping Witch is a perpetual motion engine; it constantly and reliably fuels Shelirionach\u2019s MP. Unlike other mages who have to pick their shots and use cheaper forms of CC like the AOE debuffs (Dilto/Morlis/Balfeos) or statuses like Sleep to make large groups of enemies more manageable, Shelirionach is free to cast higher levels and therefore more expensive damaging spells, recklessly. Death; the best kind of CC! Shelirionach is allowed to deal, frankly, unreasonable amounts of damage in the long run compared to every other mage in the game while also being just as good at playing the \u201cdebuffing mage\u201d role as her peers. The particulars of how this passive works include some extra bonuses for no reason! Shelirionach will regain MP, cast Slumbering Darkness and won\u2019t take double damage while asleep no matter how she got put to sleep, meaning she is functionally immune to this status condition. While asleep, her Eyes That Know the Future skill can still proc, allowing her to mitigate or outright dodge mortal wounds. WHILE ASLEEP. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, this passive dodges spells just cuz\u2019, making it even less likely that an enemy can interrupt her sleep. Assuming the hit meets the \u201c&lt;50% of Max HP\u201d pre-requisite, it will activate something around 70% of the time!</p> <p>Also, Also; the spell she casts while asleep, Slumbering Darkness, is equivalent to Zelos 6 and costs 0MP. Actually, it\u2019s more like it costs negative 16MP since you gain that much anytime you cast it\u2026at minimum. Oh, did I mention she casts this every turn for however long she stays asleep? At that point, you\u2019re practically encouraged to upcast spells at higher levels just to deplete your MP to oscillate around 20%-30% of your max MP and access this move every battle. </p> <p>My favorite fun fact is that the reworded Mental Unity description specifies that it increases the \u201cDamage of attack spells that consume MP\u201d, but for some reason still applies to Slumbering Darkness. Imagine this; Begin fight with &gt;25%MP. Sheli\u2019s turn, cast Mental Unity, fall asleep +8MP. Sheli\u2019s turn comes back around, still asleep, boosted slumbering darkness for 1300dmg, +8MP\u2026</p> <p>In conclusion, Drecom realized that legendaries need to be compelling and finally made something worth investing in. Do not listen to the downplay. What other mage can do even half of this nonsense?</p> Karkarov's Analysis <p>So the queen Sheli has gotten her rerun and a new class, Priest!</p> <p>So I am going to front load this analysis right now, if you are expecting to hear a lot of negative info, or for there to be catch 22's with Shelirionach... uh there really aren't any catches and I wont have much negative to say beyond \"she is a banner character so you have to spend limited reources\".  Sheli is simply put the best caster in the game at this point.  She was already the best mage, with the priest alt class she is now top of the world in the casting role.  So as of 9/11/25 (when I started writing this) there is no better mage/priest in this game, no, not even Alice, it isn't even close actually.</p> <p>So lets go into why that is.  First off is her unique passive skill which does a large number of different functions.  So \"Dream of the sleeping witch\" causes her to go to sleep if she falls to 20% max mp.  While asleep she will do a few different things.  First, she regens MP every round she takes a nap.  No other character in the game right now can regen MP outside potions (rare and hard to farm) and rest spots in dungeons.  Second she starts casting a single target bomb dark attack that is equivalent to roughly Zelos level 5-6... and she casts it for 0 MP.  To add insult to injury she also does not take bonus damage when asleep, unlike every other character in the game.  Being asleep also makes you immune to other mind effecting spells like Charm.  Best part... this counts for when enemies put her to sleep too, these effects are not tied to her 20% MP threshold, it just happens for sure at that point.  Vampire put Sheli to sleep?  Vampire just made a VERY big mistake, because to Sheli, Sleep is a buff.</p> <p>Then there is her inheritable skill \"Eyes that know the future\".  This skill is actually one of the most powerful tanking skills in the game.  When Sheli is hit with an attack that takes over half her health she will either A: dramatically mitigate the damage making it do significaly less than 50% of her HP or more, or B: Go \"nah I win\" and simply dodge the attack taking no damage at all.  The dodge happens at give or take around 20-25% rate, but the mitigation at level 1 of the skill on Sheli is basically 100% proc rate or so close it doesn't matter.  Also funny story, this mitigation/dodge CAN proc while she is asleep, and it works on any attack that targets her including spells.  This means Sheli has one of the only means in the game of dodging spells, all the evade stacking in the world cant do that for you.  Also somewhat sadly, as an inherit this skill is basically worthless.  The mitigation falls to sub 25ish% activation, and the dodge is single digit percent chance maybe not even 5%.  Leveling it also seems to have little to no benefit so the moral of the story is .... Sheli is not a good character to pull for using as an inherit.  This includes on Sheli herself, leveling the skill basically only improves the dodge rate for her, and not by much.</p> <p>This brings us to the reality of how meta Sheli is for traits / stats.  As a dark element female elf she gets the best possible base stats for a mage, and elf generally have the best caster stats for their racial growths.  Then her discipline is greatly improves Magic Attack and Action Speed.... the best possible discipline for a mage.  You pull a Sheli with an IQ boosted stat at level 1, good bonus points, invest it all in IQ, and she can easily break 90 IQ by herself.  She also has really strong action speed growth normally. So with a weak inherit, and absolutely meta discipline, it is obvious any dupes should go straight to pumping the discipline level of Sheli.</p> <p>Then last but maybe not least... she now has Priest as her alt class.  So if you want a tankier but still strong caster Sheli you can do that with priest.  This means she will also learn all the buffs, debuffs, heals, and attack spells (dark element at least) of mage and priest.  So she is a casting powerhouse.  Oh no!  She doesn't have a buff/debuff extention!  Ok, inherit one Alice on her, now she does.  She is also evil alignment so works with Alice's damage buff on the back row if you want to use both.  Or Milana's damage buff if you put her in front row as theif.  Or a few different dark element or elf based buffs, etc etc.  She is simply very easy to fit into your party comp, unless you are just an auto attack farmer where you don't want casters at all.</p> <p>The most critical thing about Sheli is she is one of the VERY short list of characters in this game where pulling one copy IS good enough to just put them in your team.  Her discipline is top tier, but she does not \"need\" her discipline levels to be good.  She doesn't \"need\" any inherits other than the inherits any caster would want.  You can pull her and she is instantly good to go to do her job, she just needs some gear, some levels, and some normal caster inherits.  Just like every other character.  She just doesn't need discipline, to level her own skill, or to inherit skills from other characters that aren't normal \"Mage\" inerhits etc.  There is no \"gimmick\" to make her work, she just works outright.</p> <p>There are no must pull characters in this game.  Shelirionach is really, really, really close to meeting that requirement though.  This is a character that has no real weakness, has the best MP economy in the game, and has a meta set up for their class and role from a traits perspective.  There is no catch 22, everything about her is good.  Other than her alignment, that's evil.</p> Shiro's Analysis <p>Let\u2019s start with her inheritance. It's a really great passive source of survivability similar to Adam\u2019s. There\u2019s no reason why you wouldn\u2019t want to inherit it just for a bit more of a chance for a better survivability because while combined with Adam inheritance, priest book and WotK your character suddenly becomes something way tankier than you could expect.</p> <p>Moving to her passive. While it's amazing on first glance and definitely great for all around purpose it can be a double edged sword. It surely works great on more regular enemies and bosses. Being basically \u201ccheat\u201d ability for farming purposes. Especially after auto changes as a priest. But what happens when you get into an actual hard boss fight where mages simply don\u2019t perform well as damage dealers and she goes to sleep instead of being able to cast important buff/debuff or heal? Just pray that whoever else in your team also fits this role will make up for that dead turn or few. </p> <p>Going to her discipline, it\u2019s the same as Adam. Nothing much to say. It\u2019s really good but it doesn\u2019t bring anything specific to be worth chasing over her inheritance.</p> <p>Her class change is priest which is completely pushing her further into an amazing position as generalist. Because you can go for endless farming routes spamming DIOS or cleanses as much as you want because she\u2019ll always regen MP. Also the best of course class change for mage.</p> <p>To sum it up. While Sheli is best generalist caster doing an amazing job at farming/clearing abyss she falls on boss scenarios not bringing anything as important as Alice gamebreaking buff duration or Madam/Miliana buff for the team. On top of that her passive ability can sometimes be an issue and ruin harder fights with bosses if you run out of mana fast. She\u2019s unarguably the best caster for general abyss and farming by breaking game mechanics with MP regen but it becomes unimportant/problematic in boss fights where it eats one turn for just 8MP and skill that comes nowhere close to what fighters can hit. In short, she\u2019s falling behind the best caster we have - Alice and options like Madam or Miliana when we\u2019re dealing with a really hard fight despite her min-maxed female-elf-dark setup. Going for knight \u201crecovery\u201d passive is some sort of way to deal with it but then it\u2019s basically ruining the purpose of what Sheli is - QoL for general content that\u2019s not made for bosses in main idea.</p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/details/Shelirionach/#adventurer-pull-plans","title":"Adventurer Pull Plans","text":"TheAxolotl's Pull Plan <p>I really like Sheli, so I pulled for a couple copies with the goal being a base copy and an OCD Discipline copy.

We won't see her true potential for a few days at least since Samurai seem to be following the Ninja's advanced class experience trend, so this review is very subject to change, but at an initial glance, I absolutely love her kit and play style.</p> <p>First, let's talk about her non-inheritable skill, Ephemeral Illusion Stance. This is our first \"massive\" type skill, which hits extremely hard with good gear. By extremely hard, I mean boss-killing hard where we're easily seeing mediocre-geared Shious hitting for 6k+ damage. It does have some pretty big limitations, but it is complemented extremely well by the rest of the Samurai kit in general. Speed tuning your party will be quite important for this, since the 30% HP requirement can put her in \"one more hit will kill me\" range, so being able to heal Shiou up after she attacks but before the enemies attack will be helpful. In addition, there is a bit of anti-synergy with Lana's post-battle heal if you're looking to use this skill when farming, however it should be a non-issue during Sentry or boss fights.</p> <p>Moving on to her inheritable skill, Lingering Blossom is interesting. At a glance, it's a souped up Warrior's Battle Cry in that it provides an Attack Power boost, a Surety boost, a Savia-like taunt, Shelirionach-like protection from dying due to damage, and further Attack Power, Surety, and Evasion increases upon not dying. The additional functionality in this skill is much harder to evaluate since we are unable to see the actual magnitude of stat changes in combat, however it has great synergy with Ephemeral Illusion Stance, as well as a couple other Samurai passives. One thing to note is that the Attack Power boost seems to be roughly comparable to a level 1 WBC, however WBC is going to be much easier to inherit to higher levels, so it likely won't stay competitive from a pure Attack Power boost perspective. The value prop here is in the entire host of buffs that the skill provides. If inheriting to another adventurer, the skill wording implies that the only reduction is going to be on the proc component but not on the initial Attack Power + Surety boost. That needs to be verified for sure, though. Inheriting this to another adventurer probably won't be that useful given the easier accessibility of WBC as an inherit, but it has the potential to be incredibly powerful on Shiou herself, as long as you're willing to spend a turn on it.</p> <p>Regarding buffs, the Attack Power and Surety boosts from Lingering Blossom each take up one of the buff slots, so be careful if you're using this in combination with MACALDIA or Prayer of Rebellion, as you can inadvertently push off a buff you don't want to. The increased chance of Shiou being targeted appears to act as a self-affliction and does not go against the buff count, which is an important consideration. Casting MACALDIA first and Lingering Blossom second results in Shiou having 2 Surety buffs and one Attack Power buff, which is pretty much ideal for her.</p> <p>Samurai in general are at their best when actively using skills, so they might potentially be weaker than Fighters if you're just doing auto-attack farming, however there are some reports of Shiou (or Samurai in general) being able to put out FPS levels of damage every turn, which is quite substantial.</p> <p>One other thing to note is that Cresting Wave Stance actually uses a basic attack for its damage, which is able to trigger Follow-Up Attack. While this won't ever contribute a large amount of damage, it's still a nice bit of synergy that exists.</p> <p>Regarding her Discipline, you can't do any better than Attack Power + Surety for a physical damage dealer. That being said, I personally think saving any dupes for inheriting to her own Lingering Blossom is likely going to be the stronger option overall, just due to the high value prop of her self buff. We can't see the magnitude of the increases, but it should be much more substantial than the paltry increase to Attack Power and Surety that Discipline provides.</p> <p>There are a few important legendary inherits to consider for her, as well. She will greatly benefit from Alice, Debra, and Adam inherits. The latter is least important, but can be quie nice since Ephemeral Illusion Stance is locked to the Air type.</p> <p>All in all, this is probably my favorite kit for a single purpose damage dealer. In many cases, Ephemeral Illusion Stance skill will not be seeing use, but the synergy she has in her kit as a whole is really exciting to me, and I'm looking forward to experimenting with her over the next couple weeks. Keep in mind that many people will not like the high risk nature of her kit, so before pulling, consider what you want from a physical damage dealer.</p> Frobro's Analysis <p>Sheesh; this one is not straightforward at all. On one hand, Samurai as a class seems needlessly complicated for what amounts to damage on par with fighters, or, for more work from both grinding their specific gear and manually using skills in battle, a little better. On the other hand, this feels like Sheli 2.0. Mind-numbingly high damage from her bizarre uninheritable skill out the box\u2026that we can level up for some reason?</p> <p>Let's start with the small stuff. Air + Beastfolk + Female helps alleviate Samurai's lower speed problem without needing to waste buff slots on ASPD, which especially matters here because you\u2019re gonna want all the buff slots for Lingering Blossom (ATK/SUR/EVA). Can we talk about how this is the best of all these \u201cAggro\u201d skills? This makes Savia\u2019s and Aldric\u2019s look even more whack! She just needs to get hit; it doesn\u2019t matter if the hit can\u2019t be countered, and it has built-in protection from taking more damage than she can handle. Getting the buffs even if you don\u2019t \u201cpersevere\u201d is crazy compared to what happens if Savia/Aldric don\u2019t get targeted during theirs.</p> <p>The basic idea is that you use Lingering Blossom to get the buffs and into critical HP to follow up with Ephemeral Illusion to one-shot anything that isn\u2019t a current endgame superboss. This skill is incredibly strong and would futureproof the unit by itself, but then they gave it skill lvls so that it can never fall off (So long as you\u2019re down to codex it)! Oh, and an ATK/SUR discipline because they gotta make extra sure she\u2019s strong!</p> <p>A boss killing Legendary is a new idea, and the trade-off is that she\u2019s a weak auto-battler\u2026in a game where 80% of the play time is farming! Looking at how Abyss 3 is structured, with dedicated farming caves for specific kinds of gear and several optional post-Gatekeeper superbosses, and how this unit functions as a specialized boss killer, I think the direction the game is heading is clear. If I am right, the idea being that we are to grind specialized gear to take down the increasingly demanding, optional superbosses, then this unit could be a Sheli-tier MUST PULL for low-spend accounts\u2026assuming you\u2019re down to put in the work grinding for Samurai katanas. Unlike with Rinne/Kiriha\u2019s dual release, Bugen is not a solid budget replacement for Shiou. I am evaluating Shiou separately from the Samurai class here.</p> Karkarov's Analysis <p>So, many days and many moonns have passed since Shiou's original reveal, and how she has once again returned to the banners!!!  However A LOT has changed since her original release, so it is time to completely rewrite this analysis as of 11/29/25.</p> <p>So originally there was a theme of how Shiou was complicated, while this remains true it is really for different reasons.  Her Ephemeral Strike skill remains possibly the highest damage skill in the game at level 1... but it is also so complex and risky to use because it requires her to be below 30% hp and have speed buffs/speed tuned caster support that frankly... you should neve even attempt to use this skill in any meaningful fight.  If you are some no lifter with a 200+ speed caster with tons of alice inherits and know exactly what you are doing go for it, but I don't write reviews for the 1%.  Long term this skill has really turned out to be a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing.  If you naturally end up in a 30% hp scenario to use it, great, just don't try to force it.</p> <p>So where is the complexity coming from then?  Well it is the elephant in the room, unlike when Shiou was originally introduced there is no longer any event making it easy to get a katana.  A new player today will basically find themselves with only three choices for getting a weapon for her.  Spend to get a Kiku Ichimonji (lucky purple bone pull or 100 points), go farm sand shadow cave for weeks (you do have it unlocked right?), or wait for abyss 4 and pray ninja/samurai weapons are not rare drops in there like they are in the other 3 abyss.  To add insult Samurai is also the hardest to gear class in general.  You want to avoid percentage bonuses because by nature of the class they only get 60-65% of their attack power and magic power to begin with.  So a line of +20% attack power is actually a line of  +12-13% attack power.  So you have to stack Attack Power, Magic Attack Power, avoid %, still get some Evasion, still get some Surety, don't forget Accuracy, and still get Action Speed.  Meanwhile every other DPS class can use % attack power, and just stack Attack.  These best part is after you gear this Sam... the gear is basically Sam only the second you class change you want to swap it all out.</p> <p>So to make it clear, hard to gear, +needs a gacha weapon or a abyss 3 farm spot for katana, gear is class specific due to stats needed, and they have high exp requirements due to being an advanced class.  This cocktail produces a fine Whiskey called \"Stay the hell away if you are a new player\".</p> <p>Bamboo Splitter remains great DPS.  Too bad the only way to level it is EXP scrolls, and to use it you still have to enter Cresting Wave Stance first which increases the damage you take by 25%.  This means to Bamboo (and you want to Bamboo) Shiou has to put herself in easy 1 shot range even at higher discipline for any fight with large mob numbers, enemies that just use magic, or any hard hitting physical enemy she doesn't have a Quickdraw Stance ready for.  A recent funny image I saw was someone saying \"Killed Sealed Greater Demon, and Shiou never died!\" and if you looked at Shiou's fort it was in the teens showing she clearly died, a lot.  Everyone else was at 100 or at the least well over 50.</p> <p>That said Quickdraw is still super powerful as long as you are fighting either small enemy groups who never use magic, or one super hard hitting enemy who can only attack physically like a Cyclops.  This is really the only kind of fight Shiou actually excels in these days, which means yes, she is effectively now a niche character designed to lure in big hits from physical attackers so she can quick draw counter.</p> <p>Well she still does more damage than a fighter bro!!!  Yeah in the above two scenarios where you get Bamboo going without her dying, or it's just a counter fest niche fight, she does.  But if you don't get Bamboo going safely?  If the fight is not a counter fest?  Then no, she isn't doing more damage than a fighter, in fact she will do less.  The two hand changes also made her damage advantage from the past far smaller than it was on her release as well.  So even when she does get going, she is no longer clearly in the lead, just slightly better at a cost of far more risk, weird gearing, and way higher exp needs.</p> <p>But she now has Fighter as a class change, she must be meta, SHE BREAKS THE SPINE OF THE GAME BALANCE!!!!! Yeah absolutely not, Fighter was actually a bad class change for her.  Every skill she needed from Fighter was already inheritable through multiple sources.  Effectively all she gained was a guaranteed level of Way of the Warrior (you really only need 1), a free level of Follow Up Attack, and a free level of Counter Attack (PS: Counter Attack can't proc when you are in Quickdraw stance).  You can swap her to fighter and start using her that way, but again, the Gear won't carry over, she will need completely different gear for each class.  Also Samurai likewise brings nothing to Fighter.  Quickdraw, Bamboo, even Cresting Wave are all Samurai only and you can already inherit Bugen's for Decisive Torso Strike on a fighter if you want to.... but DTS is already just Heavy Attack with sprinkles.  They are really the same skill just one costs a little less SP and does less damage, and the other costs more SP and does a little more damage.</p> <p>In short, there is no synergy between Fighter and Samurai and everything she needed from Fighter was already obtainable.</p> <p>She still has Lingering Blossom though right?  Yes she does. Had she gotten Knight as her class change this would have been huge synergy and made her the games greatest \"tank\" maybe.  Too bad she got Fighter.  As a fighter this skill is just not really useful unless you need a defensive move to buy time for a healer to get a turn.  As samurai it is still mostly useful for setting up Ephemeral... and that just isn't worth the complexity or risk to be honest.</p> <p>Before it was time to think about opening your wallets boys... but with the two hand changes, the increasingly more common large mob number fights, super bosses more reliant on magic and status effects than physical... You should not open your wallet.  Keep it closed and wait.  Maybe with the 60-70 changes something will happen to bring Samurai back into the limelight.</p> Shiro's Analysis <p>Starting from inheritance it\u2019s working great on Shiou, Galbados or Savia. But I wouldn\u2019t personally recommend going crazy over it and let your priests do the buffs in a team. It\u2019s good for a niche and surely works well with Will to Fight and Back-against-the-Water Formation but as for now we don\u2019t have a lot of options to use it with well and we might need to wait for GUTS focused class for better performance.</p> <p>Moving to her passive\u2026 it\u2019s actually active this time. And hella strong one. Not only can it be leveled with books it hits like a goddam truck leaving all the damaging options in the forest. With good SPD and porto it\u2019s also pretty much instant ability. And best of all? It bypasses defense. Now. How strong is it? Strong enough to kill anything including superboss on lvl 7 in single or almost single hit. The only issue? She needs to be under 30% HP which can be without issues solved by speed tuning her so there\u2019s no actual risk to it.</p> <p>Moving on discipline. Devs went completely with the idea \u201clet\u2019s make her as broken as possible\u201d and they gave her Gerulf discipline. I don\u2019t need to say much more there.</p> <p>As for class change she doesn\u2019t have any. But she\u2019ll benefit from either fighter/knight/thief for different purposes. One will push her dmg, another will let her play more on low HP and last one will push her surety damage (let\u2019s pray she won\u2019t become mage or priest for w/e reason).</p> <p>To sum it up. Shiou belongs to a new class - samurai which is simple as a stick. You\u2019re either using a counter or spamming bamboo splitter without need to think. If you drop for low HP buff then great, It\u2019s not needed though. DTS from my experience is bad on samurai compared to fighters with axes (lvl 3 samurai DTS was hitting as much as lvl 1 DTS on fighter) so it\u2019s easy skip for a skill in kit. Her elemental buffs are good but first you need to have a long enough fight and boss on which elemental advantage works. Which leaves us with basically 2 choices. Counter or Bamboo - better FPS. Which means we\u2019re left with a simple unga bunga class. The only thing with Shiou that needs a bit of thinking is setting up her nuke which you can drop with poison traps or just wait for it to occur naturally in a fight and punish the boss for what he shouldn\u2019t do - fighting back. Oh, also thanks to being wind beastfolk she have great stat setup with good speed. Because why not?</p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/details/Shiou/#adventurer-pull-plans","title":"Adventurer Pull Plans","text":"TheAxolotl's Pull Plan <p>I pulled 4 copies so far.

In addition that, her Neutral personality has the potential to make her more flexible for team compositions, but this may or may not be the case long-term, since we don't know what future releases will look like.</p> <p>Changing her class to Priest will give him a wider selection of spells, as well, making her a very well-rounded Adventurer for support or damage purposes.</p> <p>One big downside to Yeka is that her Discipline levels do not boost her Magic Power and Action Speed the way Adam's do, however it's very likely that having her Skill/Spell-Bind tolerance boosted will be quite useful in the future.</p> <p>Yeka is a boon to have on any team and due to the ability to hit multiple weaknesses, deal increased damage against undead, and prevent ambushes. She'll likely be a staple in many peoples' party, but recent additions like Shelirionach make her much less desirable than she once was.</p> <p>She still is excellent for being accompanied by Doctor, the best drinking buddy anyone can ever have.</p> <p>As our third legendary adventurer to get a second form, Yeka's is pretty much a textbook sidegrade from a mechanics perspective.</p> <p>Looking at her non-inheritable skill first, Yeka loses her bonus damage to undead, and gains more HP and damage reduction in the back row. This makes her more survivable while dealing less situational damage, however there's a big question of whether or not she needs that extra survivability. As a human, her HP is already higher than that of an Elf mage/priest, and being in the back row, she already has pretty decent survivability. More is better, but it's in no way necessary.</p> <p>On the subject of her Discipline, Yeka gains more HP but loses her Bind tolerance - again, trading something situational for something more general.</p> <p>Neither of these changes are bad, but they're also not groundbreakingly good. Her summer form is a bit more general-purpose, while her standard form has a bit more situational utility. I'd lean her summer form being maybe a hair better than her standard form, but overall nothing worth going out of your way to get.</p> <p>From a visual perspective, this is of course going to be subjective, but I'm pretty sure many people are going to pull for her legs alone.</p> Frobro's Analysis StandardEverdistant Summershade <p>Likely the single most overrated unit by the playerbase, Yekaterina. Don\u2019t misunderstand, she is perfectly serviceable and better than many other mages, but not anywhere near as potent as people would have you believe. Not sniffing the top 3 mages\u2026maybe not the top 5 either.</p> <p>She is positioned in a pretty good spot early game. Bonus damage to the undead at the bottom of Abyss 1 and bonus damage to Earth-weak enemies in Abyss 2 while resisting those enemy's attacks too. But that bonus damage isn\u2019t anything crazy like 2x so it isn\u2019t as valuable as it may sound initially. The further the game goes on the less important this early game advantage looks, even now, Shelirionach outperforms her at those stages of the game.</p> <p>Her Eye of Kalsum passive is whatever. Ideally, you don\u2019t get ambushed ever; which you can avoid with high Detect and not strafing into enemies. I suppose it becomes a little more valuable to someone who regularly uses Morgus contracts which have a set increase to ambush chance, but even then the proc rate feels so low that it may as well not be there. Maybe it\u2019s incredibly consistent at higher levels, but I have heard no reports of this. Her discipline focus is\u2026something. MP + Skill/Spell-bind. It\u2019s not exceptionally good but it\u2019s not bad. Dark/Water Elves get more MP without needing dupes and spell-binding enemies aren\u2019t exactly common.</p> <p>Early access to an attack all spell with Secrets of Maerlik is cool, but she doesn\u2019t have the MP to use it often until around the time she naturally learns Maerlik anyway. But being able to cast the ~15% stronger version is cool.</p> <p>Overall, better than the riff-raff but faces some serious competition from other units that can easily outdo her with easier access to merges or access to other team synergies and utility. (Elf-Mag, Milana, Iarumas,etc)</p> <p>I believe most people look at this one and say \u201cside-grade\u201d, but ignoring the difficulty of getting merges for the discipline, I believe that this is technically better, even if it\u2019s not flashy.</p> <p>HP + MP is preferable over Omni-bind tolerance + MP. Since most enemies don\u2019t have the means to bind you at all and most fights don\u2019t last long enough for enemies who can bind to land it on you, it feels like a wasted discipline focus. On the other hand, while MP isn\u2019t a bad focus stat, it really only keeps her MP relative to the elven casters who trade lower HP totals for higher MP and Mag Power naturally and also have some form of MP conservation/regen (Adam/Shelirionach) or dmg buff (Alice/Milana/Flut/Chadam) on top of that. The same elves that can patch up their low HP pools by increasing discipline levels\u2026The design space for non-elf mages is so bland</p> <p>A tankier mage that\u2019s less reliant on RNG-based mitigation than Adam and Sheli. Trades her 4/10 anti-undead passive for a 5/10 phys resist and small HP boost. Yekaterina is fighting for her life for 5th place! Still overrated out of 10.</p> Karkarov's Analysis Everdistant Summershade <p>Well this is interesting.</p> <p>One one hand she really isn't very different from normal Yeka.  Her Discipline seems a little weaker than normal Yeka with the loss of bonus Skill Bind Resist in exchange for more HP.  On paper losing Undead Bonus Damage and Defense also seems important but I would argue this was a marginal bonus at best considering as a pure caster she never posted \"\"huge\"\" numbers to begin with and Undead are traditionally low HP Enemies.  Her new skill being +HP and Defense when in the back row while not super impressive has a big advantage though.... it is simply always useful.  The Undead skill has no value if you aren't fighting undead, and if we are being honest they are not one of the most common enemy types plus are fairly easy to kill with magic regardless.  Mages can also always use more survivability, especially at low discipline levels.</p> <p>In short it is \"\"marginally useful skill sometimes\"\" versus \"\"marginally useful skill all the time\"\".  I think the new skill with HP and Defense wins in this case.</p> <p>In the end she does everything Yeka always did minus some damage to Undead which seems to not be super high value to me when you consider how easily any mage can wipe an undead pack to begin with.  Losing the bind resistance is honestly the biggest issue to me, but that is also sort of marginal and can always be healed anyway.  Your casters should always carry 1 scroll of unbinding... just in case.  Also I have to be honest, I really like the costume design and think this is a really cool looking version of Yeka with a great vibe.</p> <p>I am going to say I rate her slightly above (VERY SLIGHTLY) normal Yeka, but her long term value will be directly tied to the upcoming character merge changes Drecom makes.  If those changes are lack luster what I affectionately call Summer Yeka will be kinda lack luster (from a meta viewpoint) as well.</p> Shiro's Analysis StandardEverdistant Summershade <p>Along with other, standard banner characters, she has a really strong inheritance, not as good as Alice, Debra, Adam or Lana, but despite it, still a good one QoL. Also unlike Lana\u2019s you can stack it all over your team so unless you don\u2019t like Yeka really much she\u2019ll be mostly food for lvl 6 on every of your character that you use.</p> <p>Moving to her passive - it\u2019s boost vs undead. Nice in the first abyss 7th floor and in third for early floors or catacombs. It\u2019s niche at best.</p> <p>Moving to her discipline - MP is valuable because Yeka suffers from mana issues. But outside of the resistance to spell bind have low value because we don\u2019t have gear to build immunity to it.</p> <p>As for class change. It\u2019s a priest. And honestly? I\u2019d personally run her as a priest if anything. If you don\u2019t use mages as a damage dealer but support, then Yeka value skyrockets. Still she doesn\u2019t bring anything as crazy as Alice, Sheli or Madam but she\u2019s definitely a solid option.</p> <p>To sum it up Yeka is the worst legendary mage with a really bad setup (earth+human) which gives her only survivability. But if Alice as mage can survive multiple 0C GWO roars then I don\u2019t see a value in Yeka having more bulky HP. She\u2019s losing hard to best casters like Alice and Sheli, or slightly worse ones like Adam/Miliana/Flut/Iarumas fighting for life with Dino/Elf-Mag or Emil. But she\u2019s still great for the early part of the game where her buff actually matters on first abyss or in second where she\u2019s earth element. Sadly unless we won\u2019t get purely undead abyss then she won\u2019t see the light. And even if we do then Raffaello with an anti-undead 2h hammer will perform better there.</p> <p>I\u2019m genuinely confused with what devs tried to cook there. She gets more HP which is already completely unnecessary for mages. On top of that physical DMG resistance? For what? Neither 0C GWO or Necrocore can kill Alice or Sheli as mage with way less HP using their physical attacks. So unless we won\u2019t get strong physical backrow damage in A4 then it\u2019s kind of pointless.. </p> <p>But hey her discipline gives even more\u2026 HP. Yeah. Better than base one but unless Yeka won\u2019t get HP scaling skill then I don\u2019t see a point. But hey! Maybe devs really want to make Yeka a MADI focused damage dealer? Because I don\u2019t get it at all. Maybe I miss the future vision where mages get HP scaling skills. Overall worth to get if you use Yeka for merge\u2026 or get it and her gacha gear and go for MADI build?</p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/details/Yekaterina/#adventurer-pull-plans","title":"Adventurer Pull Plans","text":"TheAxolotl's Pull Plan <p>Everdistant Summershade Yeka is quite pretty, so maybe I'll pull to get a single copy for that reason alone.

This is simply going to look at his kit. All in all, he's...fine. He excels in a niche that isn't really needed, and if you're comparing him to Shiou, I'd argue that Shiou has more universal use and appeal, but let's dig in!</p> <p>First, we'll talk about his inheritable skill, Blazing Resplendence. While I don't have the numbers for this skill, it's a combination buff, debuff, and attack all in one. It buffs your fire damage dealt, increases your water damage taken, and then attacks with a Moderate attack. Not a bad one point inherit for a fight that needs fire damage, but...those really don't exist. When inherited, it seems to be ballpark a 20% fire type boost, while on Yoizou himself, it's around 25% or so. Not horrible, but the bigger problem is that there just aren't any situations where you'd need that fire damage boost to begin with.</p> <p>Moving on to the more interesting skill, let's talk about his Running Flame line. This skill, like Shiou's Ephemeral Illusion Stance, is his nuke, and at a glance, it's pretty neat. You use the skill to deal Moderate damage to a row, and then skill changes to Running Blaze. You use Running Blaze to deal Major damage to a row, then it changes to Running Inferno. Finally, you use Running Inferno to deal Massive damage to a row, then his ASPD and Evasion get debuffed. Each of these skills can be used once in a fight and they don't need to be used sequentially.</p> <p>Here's where things start to break down a bit. First, you need to use Flame-Bearer to even be able to start with Running Flame. That means a total of at least 4 turns must be taken before you're dealing Massive row damage, and at least 5 turns total if you want to use Blazing Resplendence first. If you die at any point after starting the Running Flame sequence, you'll need to spend a turn to re-cast Flame-Bearer. By the time you're able to deal that massive damage, most things that need row-level damage will be dead, so you automatically lose some value there. Also, if you happen to get to the end of the Running line and deal that Massive damage, you're going to be debuffed for 3 turns right after.</p> <p>Since you don't have to use the Running line in consecutive turns, you could save those ramped up attacks for specific turns in fights where a strong enemy might periodically summon other enemies, but it's still a decent amount of ramp up to maximize value, and your party likely has better, more efficient ways of dealing with those enemies.</p> <p>His Discipline skill, Flame of Revolt, is Magic Power and Magic Defense, which is fine.</p> <p>I will say that I do actually like the approach the devs are taking with Samurai. Giving each legendary Samurai a unique nuke is a fun way to keep mechanics interesting, and in a vacuum, I don't mind the ramp-up nature of his skill. The bigger issue is that there's just not enough content around right now where you'd get the full value out of his attacks, and there's very little incentive to use him over Shiou. All in all, he's an okay adventurer that feels relatively skippable to me. </p> Karkarov's Analysis <p>It's yo boi Yoizou, and boy am I late on this analysis.  That said better late than never, so lets get into it.</p> <p>Yoizou is a samurai elf fire element dude.  Already the problems are showing.  First off as an elf he clearly favors IQ, which is fine for Samurai especially with Yoto as an option.  However he is male and fire element which favor Str, so there is low synergy on his base character traits.  Not huge, but it doesn't help.  Also elf means lower Str and Vit, but better IQ, Dex, and Spd.  So you know, thats actually totally fine and balances out, it is even kinda good.  Though it also means lower HP and SP growth in favor of better MP growth... on Samurai... one of the squishiest classes in the game already due to Cresting Wave being all but required to start their DPS rotation... and don't Samurai mostly use SP?  This is not so good.  His discipline also is +magic power and +magic defense... nice for elf, not so special for Samurai, still no synergy with male fire element.</p> <p>At this point my opinion on Samurai is very solifified, I dont like them.  They are extremely gimmick based and only excel in fights where the enemy only attacks once, can only do physical attacks, and you can practically guarantee the attack will go at the Samurai.  Otherwise they are \"roll those dice baby\" go for bamboo spam and pray no one actually attacks them as they are carrying a +25% damage taken debuff from cresting wave.  Nothing in Yoizou's kit does anything to address this base problem with Samurai.  His inherit skill Blazing Resplendance will not out perform Bamboo Splitter by damage, increases fire damage dealt to enemies, but increases the damage he takes from water attacks.  So generally speaking Bamboo is better for damage (shock), it is only situationally better than Bamboo in fights where enemies never use water attacks (aka not abyss 4) and are weak to fire (most of abyss 4 but see water weakness).  This skill really is gimmicky synergizing on the idea you are running a fire element team.  PS Fire element teams are only meta in the Den of Wind.  Do you actually have trouble clearing the Den of Wind?  Do you even visit the Den of Wind?</p> <p>What about his non inheritable skill?  </p> <p>That would be Running Flame.... and this is where I get upset about this character and begin to question if Drecom character designers even have the tiniest iota of a clue on how to design anymore.  Running flame is effectively a fire element line aoe that does good damage, and each turn you use it becomes a stronger version of the same skill until it has been used 3 times.  It is truthfully a really solid strong line aoe attack, possibly one of the best in the game.  Maybe the best, especially if the fight lasts long enough and needs AOE all the way through.  Situational yes, but it's there.  </p> <p>So why is it upsetting?  Because to use the skill and to start building it to higher levels where the damage gets serious you have to cast Flame Bearer first.  You know... Flame Bearer, the skill that puts fire element on your weapon, gives you extra damage if the enemy is weak to fire, and is Samurai only?  So you have to spend a round just to even use this aoe at all, the round is basically wasted because it is a fire element attack from the get go meaning flame bearer doesn't actually do anything other than give a slight damage buff if the enemy also happens to be weak to fire, and the real kicker...  Even though his AOE skills are not Samurai or Katana specific... Flame Bearer which you had to use to do his aoe at all is Samurai and Katana Specific.  Meaning when Yoizou gets a class change he immediately loses the best thing about him as a character, his build up aoe attack.  They could have given this guy a Mage or Priest class change, or Knight or Fighter.  If the aoe had stayed in place it would have been a great value add and worked well in so many situations and been useful on any number of classes.</p> <p>But no lets make it Samurai only like every other Samurai skill and bake in a 1 round delay to even start using it so it is immediately a dog water trash tier of a skill.</p> <p>Drecom was cooking with this one.  Cooking themselves.  Yoizou has no synergy as a character, is even less survivable than other Samurai because of elf, and his best aspect is gone the second he changes class and even needs to burn a round (lol puns) to even use it.  Plus Samurai already brings almost nothing to class swaps to begin with.  He is not a good character, you shouldn't build him.  That's it.</p> <p>If you love Samurai Shiou continues to be the best choice (as of 2/21/26) if for no other reason than her SP, Spd, and Dex growths.  Also the fact that her inherit is situationally useful more often than any other legendary Samurai's inherit skill giving her surviveability they don't have, and her alt class is Fighter.  </p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/details/Yoizou/#adventurer-pull-plans","title":"Adventurer Pull Plans","text":"TheAxolotl's Pull Plan <p>If I get him with free bones, I might do something with him, otherwise I'm saving.</p> Karkarov's Pull Plan <p>From a character design perspective he is the coolest Samurai in the game in my opinion.

This means that if you're trying to load your Yrsa up with a bunch of Attack Power gear, her performance will be pretty bad. She needs all those ACC/ACC% gear pieces that you've been extracting in order to be able to put out solid numbers. Don't make the mistake assuming she's a bad adventurer because you didn't gear here properly.</p> <p>That being said, let's jump into her kit! While I won't touch on the Ranger kit in general, I will call out a few synergistic things with respect to what she's bringing.</p> <p>First, regarding her passive, Slayer of the White Calamaty, we've seen how good this can be on Abenius and Benjamin. We face a lot of magical beasts, so having a damage bonus there is great. This passive has an added additional bonus, that's mostly a bit gimmicky but can be situationally useful. If you happen to enter battle with a trapped enemy, the additional magical beast damage extends to another adventurer.</p> <p>First Arrow to Draw Blood is...interesting. Remember how Savia got released and was broken in a bad way until the devs released an update that fixed a bunch of things? Yeah, here's a bit of deja-vu.</p> <p>Conceptually, I like this skill a lot - based on how it reads, it provides a single target BATILGREF-like debuff to an enemy, which is neat. Furthermore, this debuff is treated like an ailment and is not subject to the 3 debuff limit, which is excellent! In addition to that, it provides some supplemental damage once it expires. For folks who look at this skill and try to compare it to an active damage skill, you'll likely be disappointed. The best way to think about this skill is as a debuff that provides damage and not as a damage skill that provides a debuff.</p> <p>The mechanics of this skill are interesting - it essentially has different \"tiers\" that provide gradually increasing amounts of damage upon expiration based on the number of hits an enemy receives while the debuff is up. The tiers are represented by different colors, and the color changes after a specific number of hits is received.</p> <ol> <li>White (16 hits)</li> <li>Pink (8 hits)</li> <li>Red (16 hits)</li> <li>Dark Red (8 hits)</li> <li>Glowing Red (16 hits)</li> <li>Gold (8 hits)</li> <li>Green (? hits)</li> </ol> <p>From here, it can proceed to blues and purples, but I'm not entirely sure how many total tiers there are or the sequence after Green. This skill has some nice synergy with Ninja parties. Ninjas getting access to Shedding allow them to take actions very frequently, and while dual wielding, basic attack and skills like Covert Strike and Yuzu's Hue can provide a large volume of hits to ramp First Arrow up.</p> <p>Here are the big downsides. First, it takes a lot of hits to increase the level. If you're looking to get to Green, for example, it'll take a total of 73 hits. That's a lot in two enemy turns, which means you also need to be using Delay Attack or Chronostasis to delay the enemy on top of likely stacking BATILGREF, as well. Why do we also need BATILGREF, you might ask? Well, remember how I alluded to there being a bug? Unfortunately, it appears as though the Attack Speed reduction portion of First Arrow does not work at all. This has been tested repeatedly and right now, it seems like applying First Arrow does not slow the enemy down the way it should. Hopefully this gets fixed, as it's a crucial element of this skill even being viable.</p> <p>In addition, folks have reported (although I haven't tested it myself) that Blessing of Agora does not extend the duration of First Arrow at all.</p> <p>Lastly, First Arrow really isn't a skill that you'd want to inherit to someone else. The inheritance damage loss will lead to a lower payoff for the large amount of work it takes to increase that damage tier.</p> <p>Her Discipline skill, Forest-Reading Huntcraft, boosts SP if you like that kind of thing.</p> <p>So, with these things in mind, I'm going to be an optimist and assume that First Arrow will be getting fixed soon. In that case, Yrsa makes a pretty solid teammate for Ninja-heavy teams. She wants parties that take multiple actions quickly, and she wants each of those actions to provide multiple hits. That being said, you don't really want to built a team around her, as the effort it takes to get First Arrow to high tiers is quite high in itself - you're likely better off using it and getting to whatever multiplier you get while taking reasonable actions, as that will give you some respectable bonus damage.</p> <p>Over all, Yrsa has a unique kit, an annoying bug, and will not be a fit for many teams. She's nothing game-breaking and is an easy skip if you're not a fan. You won't really want to run her on a party full of 2h Fighters since the number of hits you'll be able to deal in a 2 turn window is pretty limited. That being said, she has the potential to be a solid addition to faster, Ninja and Shedding-based teams. When fixed, First Arrow will hopefully have a nice spot in her skill rotation as a debuff with supplemental damage associated with it.</p> Karkarov's Analysis <p>MAJOR NOTE UP FRONT: Ranger is unique as a physical DPS class because due to how it's damage split works from the skill \"Sniper\" they derive more damage from Accuracy than they do from Attack Power.  As a result, the ideal boost/IV and BP spend if all you care about is DPS is Dexterity, not Strength.  This is different from basically every other physical DPS class, even on Samurai the other split damage formula physical DPS class Strangth and IQ are basically equal.  </p> <p>So without further ado, at long last a female Dorf has been added to Daphne, and she has a cute santa like cap too.  insert LET'S GOOOOOO type meme here</p> <p>So the question is... Is Ranger a good new class?  Is Yrsa actually a good character (why yes, by alignment for sure)? Should I spend my hard earned gem roll on these bones or save for the apocolypse? Well that is really going to come down to a you sort of thing.  Let's discuss why that is exactly.</p> <p>Ranger as a class is interesting because it is very focussed on two roles, and while one is very commonly used it is sort of non traditional to be focussed on it.  What are these roles you ask?  They are Exploration/Map clearing .... especially mapes with traps, and everyones favorite thing to do Auto Farming.  Ranger brings really nice kit to auto farming you see... they have a respectable damage aoe physical attack with Wide Volley, like all physical attacks it can also surety normally.  They have a Huehuehuehue light that can hit up to 5 times on random targets with Scatter Shot, just never use it single target as when it hits the same target it's dps falls off a cliff.  Penetrating Shot is actually a fantastic damage skill, especially when enemies are lined up back to back in a row.  Anticipated Shot is also a nice defense pen, can't generall miss, increased surety, and guaranteed surety skill if the enemy does something stupid like a \"Build up\" move.  Ok ok, sounds great lots of physical aoe options and a cool defense pen shot too.... so why auto farming specifically?</p> <p>Well cause none of these skills are going to hold a candle on single target damage vs say the previously mentioned Huehuehue, or the new fighter skills like Poised All Out Attack, and are generally not the most SP effecient attacks out there either.  It doesn't help that Yrsa's unqiue inherit skill \"First Arrow to Draw Blood\" does kinda mediocre damage, applies a pretty so so speed debuff, and even if you unload on an enemy hit with it, and they survive two rounds... her follow up final hit to the skill is not great dps either.  Also not so helpful is the Ranger version of Follow Up Attack called \"Second Arrow\" has a proc rate so insanely low I can't help but think it might be bugged.  Bolas holds up as as decent bossing skill (considering how many actions bosses get these days, jesus Drecom) but it isn't going to blow anyones socks off or anything.</p> <p>Ranger does also excel at map clearing though once you get the hang of placing their traps in areas you know enemies will walk through (I mean dude, your team \"heard\" the enemy and it is a 1 tile wide hallway most of the time... people make it sound like this is rocket science or something).  It is especially a really nice class if you DO want to manually go do Den's yourself since most of them have god awful spammy floor traps and the Ranger skills can counter them.  Just be aware you can't counter a poison cloud etc, it has to be the normal ones like floor spikes and such.  The ranger traps do need at least some thought for use though because size matters (hehehe) and if you use a log trap in a dungeon with a cieling (required for log trap) but you are being rushed by vorpal bunnies from hell... it wont help you they are too smol it will miss.  Likewise if you use a bear trap and it is some damn cyclops they are too much of a chungus and they will break it when they step on it.  Also be aware you can set off your own traps so.... don't be too dumb with how you place them.</p> <p>So long short I think Ranger is a pretty fun class that works well in the back row as a physical DPS, it's skills are awesome for clearing den's and trap heavy side dungeons like the new Alabaster Cave, and it is great for Auto Farming (particularlly Heinrico due to his unique passive), and Ranger even needs less EXP than samurai or Ninja, plus they use bows available from day 1 in the game easily.  That said Yrsa herself isn't really a stand out or must pull kind of character unless you are a dwarf stan.  Her good alignment means she conflicts with Alice's back row formation buff, and a lot of people use Alice on the back row.  Her disciplie isn't bad because it gives her super extra SP and Rangers are SP hangry... but it isn't exactly exciting either.  Her skill as mentioned before is also kinda so so.  She has magic beast slayer as a passive too, but like.... there are Benjamin and Abenius with Fighter class right there.</p> <p>One last footnote for Ranger in general is they do benefit from really good speed growth, so even as a DORF with stubby legs Yrsa at level 70 with no BP investment or boosted/IV speed will still end up in the high 50's for speed.  Like 57-59 ish probably.  This beats your average level 70 fighter so it aint bad.</p> <p>All in all, she is an interesting character, I think Ranger is an interesting a fun class, but do I think she is definitively better than Standard Ranger Heinrico?  No, she is, but it isn't some big gap it's pretty small.  Am I going to boot someone for my standard progression party to make room for a Ranger?  No.  I might slot one in on my Auto Farm team though. </p> <p>So the value of this banner really is going to come down to you.  If you can justify spending on a cute sweet nice gal female DORF character that really shines in auto farm and trap filled hell holes like Den of Earth, go for it. You will find a character that really can be a value add in a lot of farming situations (just don't trick yourself into thinking Ranger is a Treasure Chest class, it is not).  If all you care about is META GIMME META DPSSSS GRAAGGWEWRAAAHHHHH<sub>!<sub>~</sub>!</sub>  Then you should probably pass.</p> Shiro's Analysis <p>So we got the first legendary ranger. Class seems to be made around exploring and map traveling/qol with farming ability thanks to AoE more than boss killer type class unlike everything we had so far. </p> <p>Going to her inheritance and passive. Her inheritance is good vs enemies with high eva/aspd, so mostly A4 enemies and probably some bosses? Might be a good debuff on sealed demon but I\u2019m not sure about it myself. Damage seems to be good and it stacks with the number of hits the enemy gets during it. </p> <p>Her passive is great for farming, similar to Abenius having beast slayer is the best choice for a farmer and if you use traps it also lets another ally to benefit from beast slayer! So great choice for farming with traps! Outside of it she can be of some help against the wolf boss in A4.</p> <p>Overall? Nothing you need to spend on it. But thanks to great passive/disc and inheritance for A4 she\u2019s worth considering to be your choice for a pull. If you need AoE that\u2019s it. A really great option but nothing amazing as for now. Unless I miss something. Also takes more xp than base class and less than advanced ones.</p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/details/Yrsa/#adventurer-pull-plans","title":"Adventurer Pull Plans","text":"TheAxolotl's Pull Plan <p>I pulled a couple copies, one of which went to the OCD Discipline.

Personally I don't regret it, I think Ranger has a neat little kit and is a fun class design.  That said, I am not seeing anything critical or must have here.  If you love dwarves and are excited to see the first female one in game, go for it.  Don't feel like you are missing anything huge if you pass though.  Heinrico is also a Ranger, as a standard character is in the general pull list, and he is a great character in his own right.

We'll start with her kit.</p> <p>Thousand Hue Blossom is a very potent signature attack. Think of this as a better Wild Throw, which can hit a single target multiple times. This gives it great use as both single and multi target scenarios. Early testing shows that an inherited level 3 Hue is roughly equivalent in damage to a level 5 Heavy Attack, which makes this quite potent both when used on her and inherited. The Charm aspect can also be convenient, but it's nothing absolutely game breaking at the moment.</p> <p>Her passive, Foxfire Assault, provides a debuff to enemies she hits during the first 3 turns that increases damage dealt to them by the party by roughly 10%. The debuff lasts for 3 turns and is subject to extension from Alice inherits, so definitely give her some of those! If hitting the same enemy multiple turns, the timer gets reset, so she can effectively maintain the debuff for 6 enemy turns without an inherit. Since it is a debuff, be mindful of the 3 debuff limit during those first turns. Also keep in mind that this is enemy turns and not her turns, so enemies that perform two consecutive actions will have this duration shortened.</p> <p>Her Discipline, Pinnacle of the Flower District boosts Attack Power and SP, which are both solid minor increases and, while welcome, aren't going to be as impactful as more levels in her skill would be.</p> <p>The biggest question people will have is around how she compares to Rinne and if she's worth pulling for. Compared to Rinne, she should be consistently doing higher single target damage, which is something that Ninjas currently struggle in. If you want to pick one to run, Yuzu is going to likely be the stronger one. That being said, nothing should stop you from running both, as they are very exceptional adventurers.</p> <p>The big thing to keep in mind with pulling for her is that we have a new class coming soon. Yes, she's strong, but she's released at a time where the meta is 2h weapons with Strength+ and we have no idea what the new class is going to bring to the table. Consider those factors before making your choice!</p> Frobro's Analysis <p>The devs set out to make a strong Kunai Ninja and boy, did they succeed! Look at everything they had to give her to get there, though. </p> <p>For starters, the extra hit from Foxifire is wicked strong compared to a basic attack and is guaranteed to land, even if you miss every other hit of your attack. Secondly, the \u201cincreased damage taken\u201d debuff is like a Lana/Alice row buff without the party synergy requirement if you squint.</p> <p>Thousand Hue Blossom is what Wild Throw should have been. Solid damage per hit, a charm chance and is usable vs a group of enemies and against a single boss enemy. Its strength is compounded by the strength of the 3hit, defense penetration Kunai introduced with her.</p> <p>If you have to use a ninja, this is the one to use, with the one caveat being that you have to give her kunai to use her Thousand Hue skill, and those aren't farmable until Abyss 3.</p> Karkarov's Analysis <p>The anniversary unit has landed and the gooners have been blessed with their fox lady beast folk evil Ninja with Japanese Geisha vibes, and her name is Yuzunamiki!  Is she actually a good character though or just all looks?  Good news, she is definitely not all looks.</p> <p>So the good, as a Beastfolk Yuzu is the statistically best suited race for the Ninja class.  With her banner including a gacha Kunai (which happens to be insanely powerful) and changes to allow the purchasing of heat haze junk with ration points, and ability to just buy a bronze kunai in the item shop, it's no longer difficult to get a kunai either.  This means you can easily slot this evil geishi fox on the back row and be fully effective while working with the Alice row buff if desired.  Her discipline for those who want to push it is +attack power and SP.  I guess it could have been Surety instead of SP but this is still a great discipline for Ninja.  Her one question mark will be the element, as she is Earth.  Abyss 4 has not been revealed yet (10/16/25 as of writing) but there is a strong suspicion it will be a Wind element dungeon, and that is bad for Earth characters.</p> <p>What about those skills though?</p> <p>First up is the unique inheritable skill \"Thousand Hue Blosoom\".  Minor damage?  Doesn't sound good.  Can charm the enemy (only on Yuzu, this is lost as an inherit), thats nice but I feel very situational.  Doesn't break charm if it hits a charmed enemy, ok nice I guess?  12 sp?  Same as Covert Strike, and Heavy Attack 3... I don't know not feeling it...  Random targets?  What is this nonsense!!!!  Oh and it doubles your number of attacks so a Ninja with a normal x2 weapon dual wield set up hit's 8 hits worth of damage.  Oh and the random target is per hit, not \"game randomly chooses one target to take all hits\" so it's functionally an AOE when there are multiple enemies.  Let's test it... oh it seems to get a damage lift on each hit also similar to Heavy Attack 3 at level 1...</p> <p>In other words... imagine if you could full power strike level 1 every turn, but in exchange it costs 2 more SP and you can't specifically target the skill.  Cause FPS level 1 is basically about equal to two uses of HA 3, and this is HA 3.... effectively twice for one skill.  Remember for the same SP cost it doubles the hits value with the same damage uplift, all you really lose is the + accuracy.  Yes, this is basically a one round, no set up needed, might charm, is funtionally an aoe, 12 SP full power strike replacer.  The only thing holding this skill back on Yuzu herself is high defense enemies, but if you get her gacha Kunai.... it has defense pen, and it's a x3 hitting kunai.  I will be specific here and state clearly it's \"hit value\" not \"number of hits\".  You still only hit for the same number you would normally, but it behaves as if each hit is 2 hits + the skill bonus damage.  Aka 2 covert Kunai still only hit 4 times, but each hit is 2 hits worth of damage + the bonus. </p> <p>So how is it as an inherit?  While it does suffer some damage loss and lose the ability to charm it still easily out performs HA 3 for the same SP cost.  Inherit this on a bow wielding Fighter or Thief = profit.  How about on the MC as Ninja with his own Kunai?  This skill gets even uglier at level 3 as even inherited it keeps pace with the HA5 damage bonus.  God forbid you go Mody Dick mode and get 2 Gacha Kunai for a total of x12 hits value of damage on Yuzu or a different Ninja.</p> <p>Seriously \"Thousand Hue Blossom\" is a fantastic skill on Yuzu, and really really good as an inherit.  This skill alone is enough to make this banner something any player should consider.  The only problem is that it is ranged only.  Maybe if we all submit bug reports and claim it should have worked on melee Drecom will cave and change it?  It wouldn't be the first time...</p> <p>What about her uninheritable unique skill \"Foxfire Assault\"?  Well one it has a cool as hell name, but is it a good skill?  Lets break down the wall of text game descprition.</p> <p>Effectively what this skill does is on physical attacks (regular attacks, or skill based physical attacks) Yuzu will do +1 additional hit on a random enemy with the damage being based on her total attack power.  So it tends to hit a little harder than her normal hits, but obviously not harder than say a heavy attack hit would.  It also can inflict a damage taken up debuff on the target (yes the Alice inherit increases the duration), and if the enemy is Charmed it wont break Charm.  Nice.  Even better, she does it on her first 3 attacks per fight, allowing her to keep this damage up debuff applied consistently.  This skill wont burn the house down (lol puns) but it is absolutely a great damage and debuff add that can last into combat for a good bit.  This skill can also proc off Flutter Dream Flash but it is a bit weak there as FDF has a damage penalty on top causing this hit to reduce slightly in potency.</p> <p>This skill makes her a very very strong auto farm unit as well.  Actually with the auto farming changes both of her skills are great for auto farming.</p> <p>Ok well something has to be bad right?  What's the bad Karkarov?</p> <p>...</p> <p>She could have been male for slightly more meta trait bonuses?  She can't use a two hander?  I don't know what you want me to say?  Oh wait there is one thing... other Abyss Guides for this wiki have advised me she is low tier on the Panty tier list due to the black color.  That's definitely a let down.</p> <p>But seriously her skills are awesome and she is now easily the best Ninja in the game.  She doesn't even really need any special inherits you wouldn't want to give to any other Ninja.  Drecom knew exactly what they were doing this time and they delievered a great character that has a very clear DPS and CC role synergy that can work well in both manual and auto play.  Also yeah, her design is great I can't lie.  They did the anniversay character reveal right with Yuzunamiki.</p> Shiro's Analysis <p>Our anniversary ninja. And honestly? A really good one rivaling well with Rinne for top stop.</p> <p>Starting from her inheritance. It's a really good source of damage but locked to ranged only (so either bow or kunai). On top of that it's a random hit. In shortcut? Unlike Rinne AoE which is better than MA, Yuzu has Wild Throw on steroids. Not only is it superior damage wise, but it also can hit the same target multiple times.</p> <p>Moving to her passive. It\u2019s stacking debuff that buffs all incoming damage on target. While on one part it\u2019s great - it's an additional hit and it\u2019s guaranteed on top of it. It also counts to a debuff limit. So can be removed by casting for example MORLIS+BATILGREF. And it\u2019s really not that impactful, similar to Lana buff. But it's still better to have it than another stat passive.</p> <p>Moving to her discipline. It\u2019s ATK+SP. Great option for ninja but not worth chasing over her inheritance IMO. </p> <p>To sum it up. Yuzu has a great setup for being a ninja (if only she had been a fire element instead of earth\u2026) and it's a completely valid option for your team for various reasons. If you need a second ninja and you don\u2019t have Rinne to fill that role then go ahead and pick her. If she ever gets a fighter option in future with access to bow we might see some absurd numbers from her. As for now she\u2019s still hitting like a truck as long as the target doesn\u2019t have too much armor. Sadly without her 3 hit kunai her inheritance dmg drops quite a bit (4 hit instead of 6).</p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/details/Yuzunamiki/#adventurer-pull-plans","title":"Adventurer Pull Plans","text":"TheAxolotl's Pull Plan <p>I pulled multiple copies because despite the current meta, I'm a fan of Ninjas, as well as her damage + utility combination and her aesthetic.</p> Karkarov's Pull Plan <p>This is a simple question.  Do you like Ninja's?  If yes, you need to pull on this banner.  Yuzu is the clear queen of the ninja class now, and as of writing this (10/16/25) her gacha Kunai even at 1 star white is not only the best Kunai in the game... it's the best one hand weapon in the game.  Even a brand new player should consider pulling here as she can be a great long term party member option, you wont be in abyss 1/2 forever.

Pull 3 copies of Yuzunamiki.  1 to use, 2 to level her \"Hue\" skill to level 3.  If you can justify it, get a Kunai too.

I don't want everyone to just follow my recommendations blindly. I also have had people ask me why I prioritize some things over others, so I wanted to give a bit more insight into what I look at and what I don't when I write an analysis.</p> <p>The main thing I look at are the two signature skills. Everything else comes secondary or is not even considered. The reason for this is because the signature skills are what separate adventurers from each other within their roles or party functions. If you're comparing fighters, for example, race and type (element) do have a minor impact on traits in stats. Usually, though, this is pretty negligible. Similarly, no adventurer is made worse by getting a second class, while some adventurers can be made better by it. To that end, I really don't consider the secondary class unless it's a major gain. Livana getting Knight, for example, is extremely synergistic in a way that sets her apart from other Fighter/Knight combinations, which Shelirionach gaining Priest just adds the same utility that other Mage/Priest combinations have.</p> <p>The signature skills, however, fundamentally impact both the role an adventurer has in a party and what they can provide as inheritance outside of a party. For example, look at Lanavaille. Her two signature skills end up providing a row-wide damage boost for very solid support, as well as a party-wide heal upon victory, which gives incredible role compression. By this, I mean the value she can provide to a single party is quite strong and diverse - her damage boost is welcome in any fight, while her post-victory heal in turn lessens the need to manually heal, thus conserving valuable party resources.</p> <p>Giving her access to the Fighter class doesn't fundamentally change her role as a predominantly frontline staple in many peoples' parties, but it does improve her role compression by adding extremely solid single target damage on top of it. This combination makes Lanavaille easily one of the best adventurers in the game in terms of pure role compression. That doesn't mean I'll always use her, but that does mean she's almost always a good pick in most peoples' parties.</p> <p>Similarly, one big thing that I mostly ignore in my analyses, much to the chagrin of many others, is Discipline. I do this for a couple reasons:</p> <ol> <li>I want my analysis to represent the adventurer to a large majority of the playerbase, which is going to be with Discipline 0 or 1.</li> <li>Increasing the Discipline does not fundamentally change the role or value of an adventurer. It can make them a bit better at what they do, but it doesn't have a direct impact on their usefulness.</li> <li>In general, I think that while increased stats are good, Discipline itself has extremely small per-dupe gains. A more detailed take on my opinion of Discipline can be found here.</li> </ol> <p>When I'm filling out my party and evaluating adventurers is that I always ask \"What can this adventurer bring to the party that is unique?\"</p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/legendary-requests/adam/adam-request/","title":"Adam - Unnamed Request","text":""},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/legendary-requests/adam/adam-request/#unnamed-request","title":"Unnamed Request","text":""},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/legendary-requests/adam/adam-request/#request-requirements","title":"Request Requirements","text":"<ul> <li>Adam must be on the party</li> <li>The maximum Trust Level (white heart on the stats page) must be achieved with Adam</li> </ul> <p>Once the requirements are met, meet Adam in the tavern and he will start the request.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>This request can only be finished once per character copy.

So please, let me stay here.\"  </p> <p>The people of the village who took Yuzunamiki in were not themselves beastfolk. Yet, though she was beastfolk, she was neither tormented nor struck, and indeed, they shared with her their food and clothing, and bathed her.  </p> <p>Surely there was no other place to be found like this.  </p> <p>For a time the people of the village were silent, and then they spoke.  </p> <p>\"Then, as a shinobi, can you dedicate your very life to a mission?\"  </p> <p>Yuzunamiki gave a solemn nod. The hardships of life as a shinobi were beyond her knowing. But if she were to die, there would be none left who knew her kin.

A long council was held to decide whether they could accept this outsider into their midst.  </p> <p>After several days, a ritualist came before Yuzunamiki, still awaiting the verdict, and intoned a malediction upon her. All around the girl foxfire burned, flickering and dancing with otherworldly light.  </p> <p>\"This is the village of the Violet Flash shinobi. To labor here is to become a shinobi, life pledged to its keeping. Betray the Violet Flash and foxfire shall consume you.\" Yuzunamiki bowed her head once more. Her determination had long been set.  </p> <p>Yuzunamiki entered the training of the Violet Flash shinobi. She was behind the children born in the village, so her training was even harsher, but she immersed herself entirely in what needed to be done. As long as her body was in motion, the hollow ache in her chest could be forgotten.  </p> <p>The absence of needless longing or attachment, which could impede her duties, was counted as a sign of her aptitude as a shinobi.  </p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/life-stories/Yuzunamiki/#page-3","title":"Page 3","text":"<p>Yuzunamiki pursued her training with steadfast silence, and in time she came to execute missions as a shinobi.

Though she faced perils that threatened her very life, she clung to survival, lest all memory of her family vanish from the world.  </p> <p>In those days, the East was mired in strife, with no end in sight. Under the standard of Shrine Maiden Dougen, whose presence inspired the Eastern host to seek unity, Violet Flash fulfilled innumerable missions.  </p> <p>A new charge was laid upon Violet Flash: the dispatch of spies. The objective lay in a vast pleasure quarter-the Flower District. It was a melting pot where all manner of men and women converged; a place where the most gifted of women were said to be coveted by samurai households as their consorts.  </p> <p>Yuzunamiki alighted in the Flower District: her stance a vision of perfect grace, the movements of her dance radiant, her smile steeped in otherworldly charm.  </p> <p>To any she exchanged even a few words with, her very presence was enthralling, and she quickly became the subject of wide fascination.  </p>"},{"location":"adventurers/legendary-adventurers/life-stories/Yuzunamiki/#page-4","title":"Page 4","text":"<p>Yuzunamiki was bestowed the title of supreme flower \"Princess,\" blooming in the garden of the night, and came to be called the Dancing Maiden, captivating all who beheld her.

It also applies a bonus amount to each blessing; similar to the same check point that you would normally receive when enhancing an item to +5/10/15/20. This allows you to \"double-dip\" on stats when enhancing a piece of gear altered with FAS if it hasn't been enhanced already. Using this method will allow gear to receive stats significantly higher than naturally possible, even in ideal circumstances.</p> <p>As of Update 1.12.1, Full Alteration Stones will now also re-apply Milestone Blessing bonuses on applicable items (The game will remember the item's Grade or Color), so it is now feasible to use these on items that are already +20.

When facing an enemy with 0 or extremely low defense, or when your adventurer has a very high amount of Attack Power coming from non-weapon sources, this isn't necessarily a bad assumption, but there are a few things to keep in mind.</p> <ol> <li>A large majority of the player base is not at that gear level, and it's very rare to be facing enemies with next-to-zero defense. The Greater Demon that spawns as part of the Lingering Scent request has ~100 defense, enemies with 50-75 defense are extremely common. In addition, slimes and clouds seem to have 150+ defense.</li> <li>Multiple hits come with a few trade-offs. Each hit in a multiple-hit attack rolls its Accuracy and Surety independently. If you're not at the point where you are hitting 100% of the time missing one out of two hits is effectively a 50% damage loss. If you're not at the point where you're landing Sure Hits 100% of the time, only having one Sure Hit land is effectively only a ~38% to 50% damage increase instead of the expected 75% to 100% damage increase.</li> <li>Battle mechanics such as hitting a sleeping enemy or an <code>Opening</code> only apply to one hit, so the second hit in a multi-hit attack cannot take advantage of the damage bonus.</li> <li>The passive skill <code>Follow-Up Attack</code> triggers on attack and not on hit, which effectively lets it make 2h Weapons hit for 2x damage and multi-hit weapons hit for 1.5x damage or even 1.3x damage (I'm looking at you, Blade Cuisinart).</li> <li><code>Strength+</code> is actually pretty solid. My level 50 MC has 62 STR as a Fighter. This nets an extra 56 Attack Power when using 2h Weapons. When combined with the higher base Attack Power, that gives you a much easier time getting past enemy defenses or increasing the gap between your adventurer's Attack Power and the enemy's defense, thus increasing your overall damage. This increase, particularly when you look at other damage multipliers, can end up outperforming the additional hits.</li> </ol> <p>With those points in mind, am I saying 2h Weapons are better than 1h Weapons? No, I won't ever make that blanket statement. I also won't say 1h Weapons are better than 2h Weapons. What I will do is outline a few areas where I think certain weapons really shine.</p> <ul> <li><code>Follow-Up Attack</code> builds. This skill is very powerful and can easily out-perform some active skills at high levels, while simultaneously saving your SP. You will get the most out of it with 2h Weapons.</li> <li>Turtle builds. In these builds, you generally want your front line to be in defensive mode, while your back line attacks from range. Bows and Spears can be great for this, as well as Daggers and 1h Swords from Thieves with <code>Sneak Attack</code>.</li> <li>When you are up against something with a very small amount of defense or you have extremely strong gear with lots of offensive modifiers (Attack Power, Surety, etc), 1h Swords are hard to beat. Getting multiple attacks in is very good, particularly if no hits miss and all hits are Sure Hits.</li> <li>Thieves that want to spam Precision Strike or Sneak Attack do very well with Daggers, 1h Swords, and Bows.</li> <li>High defense enemies can be overcome very easily with both 1h and 2h Axes.</li> <li>High evasion enemies can be overcome very easily with both 1h and 2h Maces.</li> <li>Front-line Knights with low accuracy can make solid use out of 1h Maces. In this role, they're much more focused on utility and potentially landing a stun than damage.</li> <li>Front-line Priests that have some turns free from healing or buffing can make decent use out of 1h Maces. They, like the Knights, can hopefully land some stuns during turns where they don't need to heal or buff.</li> </ul> <p>One other thing to keep in mind is that switching weapons in-combat doesn't cost anything. You can always pick a 1h or 2h weapon to use as your primary, then switch to something else when you face a high defense or high evasion enemy. Alternatively, if your main weapon is an Axe, switching to a Sword or Mace against very low defense enemies can net you a bit more damage.</p> <p>All weapon types are extremely viable and there ultimately isn't a \"best\" one. 1h Maces and 2h Swords do seem to get the short end of the stick a bit, but can still be very effective.</p> <p>After the September changes, 2h weapons got a massive boost and are almost universally stronger than their 1h counterparts. It's still to be determined if these changes will stay or if there will be further future tuning. TheAxolotl's opinion honestly hasn't really changed. Yes, 2h are the current meta, but you can still clear content without it. Just use the best weapons you have or your favorite weapon types and call it good!</p>"},{"location":"events/alabaster-hunting/alabaster-hunting/","title":"Alabaster Hunting","text":""},{"location":"events/alabaster-hunting/alabaster-hunting/#alabaster-hunting","title":"Alabaster Hunting","text":""},{"location":"events/alabaster-hunting/alabaster-hunting/#requirements","title":"Requirements","text":"<p>Reach Isberg, the fourth Abyss main town, to unlock in the Royal Capital.</p>"},{"location":"events/alabaster-hunting/alabaster-hunting/#guide","title":"Guide","text":"<p>Three runs are necessary to fully complete the request \"Bring Me an Alabaster Pelt\".

There\u2019ll be two new dialogue options on the guide in the beginning of the cave and now you can interact with the crystals, which require a new pickaxe (not the same from the main story).</p> <p>Speak with the blacksmith. You can choose to either do a quest to acquire ore from the goblin cave or pay 3000G for the hammer. The quest is very hard, so you\u2019re advised to pay for the hammer.</p> Ore Locations from Goblin Cave <p></p> <p>Gather Crystals: you need 4 Purification Crystals, but some of the crystals you mine will only cause cave-ins and unlock new areas. After interacting with the 4 altars again, you\u2019ll be prompted to gather 4 Entity Shards from the Earth Elementals. </p> <p>Note</p> <p>Rather than farming those, it\u2019s easier to go to the east-mid of the B2F map (7:38 Video Guide) and fight the elemental there, win and grab the entity shard, leave the dungeon, reenter the dungeon, fight and repeat.</p> <p>Interact with the 4 altars on B4F.

It's fine - more stats are always good, and if you go as far as getting up to Discipline 9, you can get a hefty ~28 added to most stats (and potentially more to the featured stats). The problem I have is that the value per dupe spent on Discipline is relatively low.</p> <p>I consider there being three main breakpoints for Discipline:</p> <ol> <li>Discipline 1: This unlocks the passive skill, and while it doesn't make a massive tangible impact on performance, I personally hate having locked skills on adventurers I use</li> <li>Discipline 6: This maximizes the +2 stats per level rate and gives us roughly +16 stats for 8 dupes (9 copies total)</li> <li>Discipline 9: Might as well go all out</li> </ol> <p>An honorable mention goes to Disciplines 2 and 5, which are the last of the Disc levels where 1 Dupe = 1 Disc (albeit to get to 5, you do have to use 2 dupes for Disc 3).</p> <p>Alternatively, Skill Inheritance can have equivalent or better impact on overall party performance for a similar or lesser dupe cost, particularly when you consider that skills generally see a jump in effectiveness on odd levels.

I don't like locked skills.</li> <li>Additional duplicates - inherit to the MC or other adventurers OR get the featured Legendary's skill to an odd level (3 is a great target, 5 or 7 are good if you have a lot of dupes) for a noticeable damage boost</li> <li>Once I hit the skill levels I want on whatever adventurers I want to give it to, only then will I consider going for more Discipline levels</li> </ol>"},{"location":"mechanics/discipline-and-inheritance/#should-i-pull-for-duplicates","title":"Should I pull for duplicates?","text":"<p>This is a much harder question to answer, as it will depend on what you plan to use those duplicates for and what your budget is.

The first two are rarely worth building because the game mechanics strongly devalue their impact. Similarly, RES formulas described below show base RES suffers greatly versus specific Tolerance boosts. Last, while EVA is EXTREMELY STRONG IN ABYSSES 1 and 2, and arguably could be placed first for all melee classes at game start, in Abyss 3 and beyond enemies start getting very high ACC. There it becomes far more important to just kill them first rather than hoping you dodge/defend. And if it is something you can't kill first, likely you also couldn't dodge it.</p>"},{"location":"mechanics/traits-and-stats/#trait-boost-commonly-called-iv","title":"Trait Boost (Commonly called IV)","text":"<p>A Trait Boost/IV is manifested in one of two ways.  First, and most commonly, a Character will have clearly improved growth in one Trait.  Normally this is visible at level 1 on character creation by 1 Trait being 1 point higher than normal.  However, this is not always the case.  This is a \"buff\" to the Trait growth rate, not an extra Trait point.  So it's possible to recieve a single Trait Boost/IV on a Trait that has poor growth for the Character/Class.  For example: a Dwarf Knight may not show an extra point of Speed at level 1, but may have a Speed Boost/IV. The second way this can manifest is as a \"Neutral\" Boost, where all Traits recieve a very small increase in growth.  This variety will not be visible at level 1 as all Traits will be their normal value.  </p> <p>It is important to note that this means you cannot tell if a given Character copy has a single Trait Boost/IV or a Neutral one at level 1 if all Traits are the normal value.  Generally speaking, leveling a Character to level 20-30 will reveal what type of Boost/IV is happening for this particular Character copy in this situation.  This is important to understand because your Character may have a Boost/IV in an undesireable Trait.  Such as a Human Fighter with a Boost/IV of Piety.</p> <p>You should know and understand that Boost/IV is just a bonus.  A Characters Trait growth is primarily driven by their Class, and Race.  An Elf Mage will always have great IQ even if their Boost/IV is Dexterity.  Even if you should have a Boost/IV with a high degree of synergy (for example a Beastfolk Thief with Speed Boost/IV) the difference between \"normal average\" and \"Boost/IV\" will generally only be 6-10 points.  If the Boost/IV is a single Trait with poor synergy (for example a Human Ninja with Vitality Boost/IV) the difference between normal average and the Boost/IV will be lower, commonly around 5-7 points. </p> <p>The biggest unknown around Boosts/IVs, though, is exactly what this means for long-term Adventurer development. Assuming we will eventually be at a maximum level of 130, it's possible that the Boost/IV means a particular Trait Point will get to a \"maximum value\" faster but by level 130, all copies of an adventurer will have the same Trait Point values.</p> <p>TheAxolotl's personal opinion on IVs is that when you have multiple copies of an adventurer to register, select the one with the IV that you prefer, as that will make a more currently notable difference in Trait Point growth than bonus points will. When you don't have multiple copies, don't worry about the IV. We don't know how IVs will play out long-term, so I personally think it's not worrying about.</p> <p>Karkarov's personal opinion is much the same as TheAxolotl's.  Ultimately it depends on the player, those who are happy to spend money and \"whale\" should absolutely be picky and wait for that perfect Character copy with the desired meta level 1 Traits.  For the average player who is Free to Play you should just use what you have and know that this is not going to make or break a Character.  There are many ways to tweak your ultimate Trait values, from gear, to bondmates, to brews, etc etc.  There is no such thing as a \"bad Character\" in Daphne.  </p> <p>You will never ruin an adventurer by selecting one with no IV or a less than ideal IV.</p>"},{"location":"mechanics/traits-and-stats/#trait-point-variance","title":"Trait Point Variance","text":"<p>Trait Points can vary across two copies of the same Adventurer, and this is due to a combination of level growth, which have an element of randomness, how bonus points were spent, and Boost/IV. For example, one level 50 Adam could end up with 59 IQ, while another could end up with 73 IQ. We don't have a full understanding of the degree of variance from level growth and Boost/IV, but when looking at those two Adams, using the chart above, you can see that there's only a difference in Magic Power of <code>(73-59)*1.2=16.8</code>. That is not a large difference, especially as our Magic Power increases through equipment.</p> <p>What does that mean? Ultimately, the impact of trait points on stats is significantly smaller than the impact of equipment on stats.</p> <p>One popular myth to be aware of, \"Lower Fortitude = Highter Trait Growth\".  This is a popular theory on Social Media based on anecdotal observations but is not true. A lower Fortitude Adventurer does not benefit from extra Trait growth and is no more likely to have high Trait growth than a 100 Fortitude character.</p> <p>What about Legendary VS General VS Anonymous Adventurers, is there a difference?  Advanced Classes VS Normal Classes?  Yes, there is a difference on both counts.</p> <p>Legendary Adventurers generally have slightly higher overall Trait growth VS General and Anonymous Adventurers, while General and Anonymous Adventurers have the same growth.  Likewise Advanced Classes (Samurai and Ninja) generally have higher Trait growth than the Standard Classes.</p> <p>Please understand this will not massively impact a non Legendary or Advanced Class Adventurers potential.

For a more fair comparison, Livana compared to Olive at 60 would be around a 5-8 point total difference on average.  </p>"},{"location":"mechanics/traits-and-stats/#what-do-trait-points-and-stats-mean-for-bonus-points","title":"What Do Trait Points And Stats Mean For Bonus Points?","text":"<p>We've often found ourselves saying bonus points don't matter.

Turn Economy is essentially a way of evaluating the value of an action taken during a turn. For example, a non-Alice priest has buffs that last for 3 turns, while Alice, due to her inheritable passive, has buffs that last for 4 turns at skill level 1. This gives Alice better Turn Economy than other priests since she can ultimately take more actions before having to reapply her buffs. It's also what makes her inheritable skill so strong - inheriting her skill to any adventurer with a buff or debuff will extend that duration by 1, giving the target adventurer better overall Turn Economy.</p> <p>Similarly, one of the big reasons Full-Power Strike is such a good attack is because of its efficiency and its turn economy. For example, you can have a Fighter use FPS on the first turn and have two turns of buffs be applied to that Fighter by a faster Priest before the FPS attack actually happens. This means you don't have to wait a turn for your Fighter to be fully buffed before attacking. Similarly, if you get hit by the Gatekeeper's Roar, you can have the Fighter use FPS while they're in the back row, then have the adventurer in front of them swap positions before the Fighter actually attacks.</p>"},{"location":"strategies/party-construction/#party-formation","title":"Party Formation","text":"<p>With these concepts in mind, how do you use them to make a powerful party?

formation, there are two other major components. Equipment and Skill Inheritance.</p>"},{"location":"strategies/party-construction/#equipment","title":"Equipment","text":"<p>As with many things in this game, there's no right or wrong way to approach your equipment, but there are some things to keep in mind:</p> <ul> <li>At lower attack power levels, 2h weapons can often lead to higher damage than multi-hit weapons due to having an easier time overcoming enemy defense.</li> <li>At higher attack power levels, multi-hit weapons will likely deal more damage than single hit weapons.</li> <li>There is very little benefit to Heavy Armor - the defense increase over Light Armor is often not worth the penalties to Accuracy and Action Speed that you'll see. There are a few exceptions, of course.</li> </ul> <p>Regarding weapon types, some people will avoid specific types. I generally don't recommend this. Instead, I recommend folks use the best equipment they have regardless of type, as for the majority of players, the actual in-combat difference when solely looking at weapon type or armor type will be pretty small. For more on weapon types, check out the Weapon Types page</p> <p>Regarding blessings, some folks like to prioritize Evasion to certain levels. Again, I'm not one of those. For any physical damage dealers, my priority is almost always Surety &gt; Attack Power &gt; Accuracy &gt; Action Speed &gt; Anything Else. For magical damage dealers, I tend to prioritize Magic Power &gt; Action Speed &gt; Surety &gt; Anything Else. For pure support, I prioritize Action Speed &gt; Anything Else. Regarding the Action Speed priority, I don't worry so much about my party always going before enemies - I'm much more concerned with making sure my party members go in a specific turn order relative to each other.</p> <p>When it comes to flat blessings vs percentage blessings, there's some nuanced math to this, but use whichever you get - flat tends to be slightly better through level 60, but you'll rarely be in a situation where you have to choose between the two unless you're farming a ton of equipment.</p>"},{"location":"strategies/party-construction/#skill-inheritance","title":"Skill Inheritance","text":"<p>Skill Inheritance is an extremely powerful way to supplement your strongest or favorite adventurers with additional functionality, and making the right choices here can turn a good party into a great party.

For ninjas, it can provide additional attacks which leads to more chances to get criticals</li> <li>Inheriting various passive skills of one class to other adventurers of a different class can help provide some additional survivability to classes that don't normally get those skills</li> </ul> <p>For a comprehensive list of skills, their descriptions, and who to inherit them from, check out the Skills page.</p>"},{"location":"tools/equipment-enhancement/","title":"Equipment Enhancement (Beta)","text":""},{"location":"tools/equipment-enhancement/#equipment-enhancement-beta","title":"Equipment Enhancement (Beta)","text":"<p>Data is sourced from:  - https://wizardry.info/daphne/gacha_rates/ja/alternations.html  - NRJank's Weapons and Armor data</p> <p></p> <p>2</p>"},{"location":"tools/loot-finder/","title":"Loot Finder","text":""},{"location":"tools/loot-finder/#loot-finder","title":"Loot Finder","text":"<p>Search for equipment and see which junk items to farm, with detailed drop rate probabilities for each quality and grade combination.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"tools/tracker/","title":"Respawn Tracker","text":"<ul> <li>The tracker gets regular updates, for some browsers you need to hard-refresh (CTRL-F5) to ensure the underlying JavaScript gets refreshed.</li> <li>Click an entry name to view its image (if it has one).</li> <li>Click \u201cCollect\u201d to record it, \u201cUpdate\u201d to overwrite, or \u201c\u27f2\u201d to undo.</li> <li>Transfer acquisition status between devices with the Export code.</li> <li>You can now create new tabs (based on the default tab template), rename tabs and any text element via edit mode using the edit icon, hide and restore hidden items with \u201cShow Hidden\u201d then re-enable them and collapse headers or subheaders using the down arrow on their far right.</li> <li>Respawn interval noted in item text if known.
